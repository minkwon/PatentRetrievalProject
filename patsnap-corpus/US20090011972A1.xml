		Surfactant for Fine-Bubble Formation
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		The present invention has its object to provide a surfactant which makes it possible to obtain microbubbles with ease, and is effective to render the microbubbles obtained stable for a long period of time. The present invention relates to a surfactant for microbubble formation which comprises a (poly)oxyalkylene adduct (A) of an active hydrogen atom-containing compound (a) as represented by the general formula (1) given below and that the foaming power of a 0.02% (by weight) aqueous solution of said adduct (A) as measured at 20.degree. C. by the Ross Miles test is not higher than 50 mm: Z-[(AO).sub.n-H].sub.p (1) (in the above formula, Z is the residue of an active hydrogen-containing compound (a) with a valence of P as resulting from removal of the active hydrogen atom or atoms; A is an alkylene group containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms; n is an integer of 1 to 400; and p is an integer of 1 to 100).
