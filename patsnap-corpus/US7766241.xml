		Barcode for two-way verification of a document
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Systems, methods and storage mediums are disclosed for processing images and two-dimensional barcodes for two-way verification of document data. In one exemplary embodiment, image data of a document is obtained, processed and rendered into a barcode for incorporation into a reproduction of the document image. The barcode may overlap the document image which allows it to be placed anywhere in the document. Moreover, the barcode may overlap certain portions such that it conceals confidential information while maintaining the integrity of the confidential information within encoded data of the barcode.
