		UNIVERSAL PORTABLE BATTERY PACK FOR ELECTRICAL HAND HELD DEVICE
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A Battery Pack includes a container or a case, which contains sufficient batteries for a full day operation of a hand held device. The battery pack is formed to be electrically coupled in a circuit to an existing battery receptacle. It also includes an adapter, which electrically engages the existing battery receptacles and thereby electrically couples the battery receptacles to the container housing batteries. The belt consists of a least one pack or more packs ( usually two packs), each of which contains several rechargeable batteries. The batteries are arranged in a circuit, which is in electrical communication with the adapter. A negative and a positive lead extend through the case and the adapter and engage negative and positive terminals in the battery receptacles, thereby electrically coupling the batteries in a circuit to the power-consuming electrical device. In this way, the power-consuming device draws power from several batteries at the same time. Therefor, the battery pack supplies the electrical device with power for l longer time than a single battery of the dame voltage. Therefor, the time between battery replacement is increased significantly.
