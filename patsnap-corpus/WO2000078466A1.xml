		HIGH-EFFICIENCY GAS DISSOLVING DEVICE
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A high-efficiency gas dissolving device (10) which has a diameter-expanded nozzle with a collision member, wherein the shearing force and cavitation of water produced in the inner space of the diameter-expanded nozzle are utilized to efficiently atomize air, etc. This device (10) comprises a nozzle main body (11) having a water introducer (14), a gas feeder (16) and a diameter-expanded nozzle (17), and a collision plate (18) fixed to the nozzle main body. The water introducer (14) discharges high-pressure water, introduced through a water feeding port (12), from a discharge port (13). The gas feeder (16) is provided with a gas introducing port (15) in the water introducer (14) and mixes gas into the high-pressure water by ejector action. The diameter-expanded nozzle (17) positively generates cavitation in the inner space with a forwardly expanded diameter by the flow of high-pressure water discharged from the discharge port (13). The collision plate (18) is disposed with a gap defined in front of the diameter-expanded nozzle (17), so that the water mixed with fine air bubbles discharged from the diameter-expanded nozzle (17) is dispersed around.
