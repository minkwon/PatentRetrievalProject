		Ultraviolet water purification system
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		An Ultraviolet-C (UVC) based portable water purification system employing a novel array of baffles increases the efficiency per unit energy of irradiating UVC light in the eradication of pathogens in the water. Closed loop feedback allows monitoring the application of UVC light power to ensure high levels of pathogen eradication. This system is capable of eradicating a wide range of waterborne bacteria, viruses, protozoa, helminthes, yeast, and mold found in natural freshwater sources worldwide. By adding pre- or post-filters, the system can remove harmful organic compounds, pesticides, inorganic compounds and heavy metals from the water. The system can also be used to eradicate pathogens in fluids other than water. As a feature of this invention, a communications systems that can reach geographically dispersed populations at low cost without the need to install costly wired communications infrastructure is combined with and powered by the water purification system. In one embodiment, a packet radio system is provided to create nodes in a wireless mesh communications system to provide voice, data, video and internet communications using an array of the water purifiers to create a wireless mesh network.
