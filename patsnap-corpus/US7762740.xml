		Fluid distribution system
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		By providing an easily transported, filler component system, leaching field forming elements for establishing a series of flexible design passageways into which the desired fill material is placed, a highly effective, easily installed, competitively priced with enhanced biological habitat underground fluid distribution system is achieved. In accordance with the present invention, the desired passageways are quickly and efficiently created by employing pre-folded cardboard panels, or other pervious materials, placing the materials in an excavated location or site in cooperating relationship with each other for creating the desired leaching fields. In the preferred embodiment, two, substantially identical, pre-folded cardboard panels are employed and are positioned in juxtaposed, cooperating, spaced, facing relationship with each other, establishing a central passageway therebetween.
