	<str name="Title">
		Rapid proliferation of aquatic plant growth facilitation system and associated methods
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A system and method for facilitating the rapid proliferation of floating aquatic plants on a body of water for use in bioremediation are provided. In a particular embodiment, a method includes the steps of affixing a weight to each of a plurality of floating aquatic plants and distributing a plurality of weighted plants across a body of water so that at least some of the plants are sufficiently spatially distributed so as to avoid interfering with each other in an initial growth phase. The weighted plants are permitted to produce daughter plants and to substantially cover a surface of the body of water. Water desired to be treated for excess nutrients is channeled to the body of water for bioremediation by the plants, and treated water is then channeled out from the body of water.
