		VISUALIZING GEOGRAPHIC-AREA CHANGE DETECTED FROM HIGH-RESOLUTION, REMOTELY SENSED IMAGERY
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method, system, and medium are provided for presenting aspects of change associated with a geographic area that has been captured by high-resolution, remotely sensed imagery. One embodiment of the method includes receiving a query directed at the geographic area that includes one or more inputs, the query seeking an identification of regions associated with the geographic area that are characterized by aspects of change based on the one or more inputs; applying the query to a dataset of geospatial information that stores imagery associated with the geographic area, wherein the dataset includes information that is sufficient to identify the regions, and wherein the imagery is derived from the high-resolution, remotely sensed imagery, which is characterized by having a resolution of three meters or less per pixel; receiving a first results set that includes a first plurality of keys and corresponding change scores, wherein, (1) each key is useable to identify a certain region, and (2) each change score indicates an amount of change in the certain region from a first state to a second state; and presenting at least a portion of the results set in a viewing application.
