		BATTERY ASSEMBLY
	</str>

	<str name="Abstract">
		The invention concerns a battery assembly (1),comprising: at least a first block(4) of rechargeable battery cell members (3) that are arranged side by side in at least one row and that are electrically configured in parallel, wherein each cell member (3) has a first and a second electrode terminal (24, 25); a printed circuit board (PCB) (10) provided with an electronic circuit (11) configured to monitor, control and/or balance said first block (4) of cell members (3); and interconnecting means (6, 7, 8, 17, 18, 20, 28) arranged to connect the first electrode terminals (24) electrically to each other and to the PCB (10). The invention is characterized in that the interconnecting means comprises a first supporting metal plate (6) that: extends along said at least one row of cell members (3); is mechanically fixed to the first block (4) of cell members (3); is electrically connected to the first electrode terminal (24) of each of the cell members (3) in the first block (4) of cell members; and that is mechanically fixed to the PCB (10) via a mechanical fixation that also provides an electric connection between the first metal plate (6) and the PCB (10). The invention also concerns a battery system comprising a plurality of battery assemblies of the above type.
