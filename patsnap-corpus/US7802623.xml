		Method and a device for destruction of organic material in injection water
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method and a device (2) for destruction of organic material in injection water for an injection well (4), in which a means (10) for introduction of water in the injection well (4), and at least one electrochemical cell (16) with associated operating means are used for in situ electrolytic generation from water of at least short-lived, free hydroxyl radicals. The distinctive characteristic of the invention is that it comprises the following steps: (A) to connect the at least one electrochemical cell (16) to the injection well (4); and (B) by means of said operating means, to conduct the injection water through said cell (16) for in situ generation of at least free hydroxyl radicals from the injection water, insofar as free hydroxyl radicals immediately destruct organic material that they engage in the injection water. The invention also comprises use of water, which is to be injected into an injection well (4), as a source material for in situ electrolytic generation of said hydroxyl radicals for immediately destruction of organic material in the injection water.
