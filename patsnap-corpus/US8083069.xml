		High throughput magnetic isolation technique and device for biological materials
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		The present application discloses a process for the high throughput separation of at least one distinct biological material from a sample using magnetic tags and a magnetic separation set up capable of processing at least about 10.sup.6 units/second. A magnetic field gradient is used to deflect target material bearing a magnet tag from one laminar flow stream to another so that the magnetically tagged target material exits a separation chamber via a different outlet than the rest of the sample. The process is applicable to isolating several distinct biological materials by directing each via magnetic deflection to its own unique outlet. The application also discloses a system for performing the process and a kit that includes the system and the magnetic tags.
