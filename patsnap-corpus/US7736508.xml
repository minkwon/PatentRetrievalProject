	<str name="Title">
		System and method for biological wastewater treatment and for using the byproduct thereof
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A wastewater treatment system and process biologically treats wastewater to produce substantially clean water effluent and byproducts. The treatment system includes an array of media wheels that rotate into and out of exposure to sunlight for sustained algae growth. One byproduct is algae removed from the rotating media wheels, which may be provided to other processing facilities to produce, for instance, bio-diesel fuel. Waste CO.sub.2 from the processing facility may also be returned to the treatment system for enhanced algae growth. Bacteria is provided to form a symbiotic relationship with the algae, fueled by sunlight to effectively remove toxic materials from the wastewater. Large scale facilities may integrate the treatment systems in a regenerative cycle in which the biomass obtained from the algal colonies is used in a separate facility and byproducts of the operation of the separate facility are used by the treatment system to fuel further algal growth.
