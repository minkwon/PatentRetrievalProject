		A SYSTEM FOR LAND RECORD INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		This invention discloses a system and method to maintain accurate information about land and retrieve and analyze the same. Multiple users have access to a centralized data store, which aggregates data, which was formerly recorded on media such as paper. The data is computerized from a variety of formats and languages and stored for use. The data has two main attributes, one spatial and the other non-spatial. The spatial component of the data is usually obtained by satellite imagery, amongst several other sources. The non-spatial component of the data is provided in turn by the teams for which the system is being developed and matters of public record. The present invention discloses a web-centric, client-server based information system and methods therein for fast, secure access to data for purposes of land management and similar applications involving data with spatial and non-spatial components.
