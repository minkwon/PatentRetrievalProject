	<str name="Abstract">
		The garment includes a plurality of surfaces that have one or more solar panels placed upon them. The garment utilizes an interface configured to transmit the collected solar energy to a storage system, which may be used to power an electrical device via a connector. This connector may power an electronic device, whereas another connector could jump start a battery. The garment could also use some of the stored energy to power one or more light-emitting diodes located on the exterior for any variety of illuminating purposes. The garment could also use some of the stored energy to power a heated article of clothing such as a removable lining, gloves, pants, and the like, or inversely, could instead power a removable cooling fan.
