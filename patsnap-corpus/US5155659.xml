		Hand-held data collection terminal with battery compartment sealing lid and lid-tethering hand strap
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A portable, hand-held data collection terminal is housed in an elongate, protective housing. A frontal surface of the housing includes a display screen and a keyboard. A battery compartment of the data collection terminal has an access opening which is covered and sealed by a lid. The resiliency of a peripheral seal of the lid also absorbes impact forces directed against the terminal. The battery compartment is closed by placing an upper end of the lid under a ledge of the housing and locking an opposite end to the housing with a detented quarter-turn lock button. Detented positions of the lock button indicate the fully locked and fully unlocked positions of the lid. A hand strap on the rear of the housing is attached to the housing and to the lid to support an operator's handgrip on the terminal and to tether the lid to the terminal when the battery compartment is opened. Two types of protectors for indicia on keyboard keys are also disclosed. One type features rigid caps with inwardly projecting ridges which dig into deformable sides of the keys. Another type protector features caps formed of pliable material with base flanges. The flanges are capatured beneath a faceplate of the housing through which the capped keys protrude.
