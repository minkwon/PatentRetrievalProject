	<str name="Title">
		Ceramic membrane water filtration
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A process for combined ozone degradation and filtration using a multi-layered, nanocrystalline, sintered ceramic, metal oxide catalyst and ceramic membrane filter is described. The process reduces fouling of the membrane and degrades ozone remaining in the water from ozonation of water to kill microorganisms.
