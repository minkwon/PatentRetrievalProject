		APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DETECTING FACE REGION
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A face region detecting apparatus includes a face detection and recognition unit for encoding a face image into a face feature code through an internal operation process and storing the face feature code in the form of a database, in which the face image is extracted in a face detection step of extracting a face image from an inputted image material; and a face detection server for transmitting the face feature code through a network, comparing the transmitted face feature code with face feature codes previously stored in a database to determine whether face features are matched, and transmitting a face recognition result to the face detection and recognition unit. Accordingly, a face image of a specific person is converted into a face feature code, whereby the face feature code can be applied to recognize and detect the specific person or to search for only the specific person from a DVR real-time input image or a recorded image screen. Furthermore, an infrared LED and an infrared iris are provided in receiving an external image of a person, thereby making it possible to stably obtain a face image without being affected by uneven brightness distribution or inconsistent external light source environments.
