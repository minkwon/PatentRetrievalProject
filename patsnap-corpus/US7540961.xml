		Methods for manufacturing hydrogen using anaerobic digestion
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method for manufacturing a biomass enriched with hydrogen-producing bacteria or spores includes providing a biomass comprising a hydrogen-producing bacteria and a competing bacteria and treating the biomass with a sufficient amount of a chemical agent for a period of time such that the treatment (i) kills, inhibits or injures substantially all of the competing bacteria and (ii) does not kill or inhibit the hydrogen-producing bacteria or causes the hydrogen-producing bacteria to form spores that are not destroyed during the chemical treatment. The method also includes digesting an enriched biomass with a non-sterile organic substrate. The enriched biomass includes hydrogen-producing bacteria or spores that are mixed in sufficient quantities with the organic substrate such that the hydrogen-producing bacteria can overcome the competing bacteria to consume the organic substrate and produce hydrogen.
