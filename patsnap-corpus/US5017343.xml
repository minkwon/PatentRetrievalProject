		Low pressure mixing apparatus for atomizing fluids
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		The liquid feed injector as hereindescribed uses sequential stages of increased severity mixing to fully atomize a liquid portion of a combined liquid and gaseous stream. Sequential mixing consists of a first mild mixing that takes place in a mild mixing zone and blends the liquid and gaseous material into a substantial uniform mixture. The uniform mixture of liquid and gaseous material passes through another stage of vigorous mixing where the liquid is sheared and gas is dispersed throughout the liquid by dividing the mixture into a plurality of small streams and directing the projection of the streams into impingement with an impact medium to produce a homogeneous mixture of fine gas bubbles dispersed in the liquid. The homogeneous liquid and gas mixtures are then discharged through one or more discharge nozzles to effect atomization and distribution of the liquid in a suspension of fluidized solids. The sequential stages of increased severity mixing allow atomization of the liquid into fine droplets with a reduced pressure drop across the discharge nozzles. In a highly preferred form, the liquid injector includes provisions for injecting two fluid streams into a suspension of fluidized solids at two discrete locations.
