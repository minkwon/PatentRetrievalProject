	<str name="Abstract">
		A wireless device having a remote station portion, such as a cellular telephone, PDA, laptop computer, handheld computer, or the like and a removably connectable medical device portion, such as a blood glucose monitor or the like, is provided. The medical device portion is separated from the remote station portion by an isolation circuit and electromagnetic shielding to inhibit the electronics and radio frequency transmission of the remote station portion interfering with the medical device. Moreover, a control processor in the remote station portion has a battery management module to disable functions as the charge in the power source falls to provide sufficient power for operation of the medical device.
