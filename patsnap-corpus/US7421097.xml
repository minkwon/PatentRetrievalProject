		Face identification verification using 3 dimensional modeling
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A checkpoint screening system uses multiple cameras to provide images at different angles of a person to be screened. Different features extracted from the images at different angles are compared to a profile associated with the person to be screened. In one embodiment, the person first provides an ID, such as a drivers license or other identification, and the profile is retrieved. If a match is detected, the person may continue through the checkpoint. If no match is detected, the person may be directed to a different path through the checkpoint for further verification of identity. A registration process is used to enroll members and obtain a member profile. Three camera angles are utilized to provide a three dimensional image. Each image is independently compared against the profile and the decisions from such comparisons are weighted. The profile is regressively updated and weighted if a match is detected.
