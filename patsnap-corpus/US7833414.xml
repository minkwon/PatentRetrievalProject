	<str name="Title">
		Polar fog waste treatment
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A FOG waste treatment facility includes a slipstream loop incorporating circulation pumps, heat exchangers and anaerobic digesters for continuously circulating actively digesting sludge at a rate to preclude solid settlement accumulation warmed actively digesting sludge is pumped from the slipstream loop through a rock trap into a delivery/input loop both for aiding delivery of FOG waste to, and for partially filing, a receiving/conditioning holding tank. The actively digesting sludge softens and liquefies the FOG wastes offloaded into the holding tank for further treatment at a desired treatment temperature range. The contents of the receiving/conditioning holding tank are continuously mixed by a bottom-top recirculation chopper pump to pre-treat the FOG wastes, and decreasing solids particle size. The produced, flowable feedstock slurry can then be injected back into the actively digesting sludge slipstream loop at a controlled rate. The resultant mixture then is introduced into the input of waste treatment systems having anaerobic digesters for digestion of solids.
