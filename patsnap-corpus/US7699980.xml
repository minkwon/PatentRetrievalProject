		System for activated sludge wastewater treatment with high dissolved oxygen levels
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		An activated sludge wastewater treatment system is provided. The disclosed system includes: an uncovered activated sludge basin; a high purity oxygen aeration system; a secondary clarifier; a return activated sludge line and a waste activated sludge line; wherein the system operates at a solids loading of between about 3000 mg and about 10000 mg of suspended solids per liter of mixed liquor; a dissolved oxygen level in the aeration basin in the range of between about 5 mg to 15 mg; and a solids retention time of between about 7 days and 40 days.
