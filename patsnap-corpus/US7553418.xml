		Method for water filtration
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		This is a method of filtration of a liquid comprising steps of sequential filtration of said liquid through at least one deep bed medium producing at least one first filtrate followed by at least one membrane medium filtration producing at least one second filtrate, wherein said membrane medium is at least periodically within said deep bed media Many types of deep bed and membrane media can be used. The domain of using contact clarification (direct filtration) can be expanded towards greater solids concentration. Operation and backwash, is simplified, continuous filtration becomes possible. Water can be water from natural source water, process water, wastewater, aqueous or non-aqueous suspensions, emulsions, solutions. Treatment can include mechanical interception of suspended particles, chemical, physical chemical, electrochemical, and biological processes. In water and wastewater processing, control over suspended solids, BOD, COD, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, bacteria and viruses, heavy metals, color, and other constituents can be dramatically improved as compared to conventional processes. The method can be accommodated in new and modified existing treatment systems.
