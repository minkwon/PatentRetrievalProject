		In line wetland water treatment system
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A complete storm water management system and process which performs both drainage and treatment tasks and incorporates a wetlands water treatment system. This system creates an infrastructure, flow control which is multi-level and multi-stage. This system incorporates a self-contained wetlands treatment system. This is a modular system which includes three or more linear chambers through which the storm water or other influent passes and is cleaned. The influent which flows into a storm drain, curb inlet, or inflow pipe into the system is directed first into a screening type catch basin inset filter within the first chamber of the system. The wetlands chamber is composed of one or more modular segments which may be made in various depths, lengths and widths. The influent is treated within the first chamber before it passes out of this chamber into the incorporated wetlands system. The water flows through the wetlands chamber where it is further filtered and decontaminated through both an aerobic and anaerobic process. In situations of high runoff there is a bypass component which runs directly from the first chamber and bypasses the wetlands chamber dumping the pretreated water into the discharge final chamber. This system is fitted with a variable level treatment component designed in such a way to offer variable discharge rates and thus vary the level of treatments over a wide range of flow rates. The system can be placed underground, and below concrete, such as in parking lots or park areas.
