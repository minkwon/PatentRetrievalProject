	<str name="Abstract">
		The present invention provides a sugar chain purification instrument which can continuously and efficiently purify the sugar chain. According to the present invention, the instrument includes an immobilized protease column in which a carrier which can be packed in the column and on which protease is immobilized is packed and an immobilized glycopeptidase column in which a carrier which can be packed in the column and on which glycopeptidase is immobilized is packed, these columns being connected in series, and the reaction is carried out while continuously passing a glycoprotein to be decomposed together with a suitable buffer solution through the above columns. The step of liberation of sugar chain from the glycoprotein is highly simplified and labor-saving, and liberation of the sugar chain can be moderately and simply performed.
