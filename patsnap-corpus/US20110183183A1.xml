	<str name="Abstract">
		Disclosed is a stacked array of a plurality of thin film batteries that are electrically connected together. The stacked array is in a staggered configuration. The outermost points of side edges on one side of the stacked array preferably generally conform to an interior surface of an electronic device or component thereof in order to advantageously save space in the device. In an embodiment, the stacked array comprises at least one battery having a single surface in contact with a plurality of batteries. In another embodiment, a shaped array of a plurality of thin film batteries electrically connected together is provided, whereby a plurality of batteries are arranged in a single layer on a non-rectangular substrate adjacent to one another generally in the shape of the surface of the substrate. Additionally, a thin film battery is described wherein at least one via is provided through the substrate and at least one other via through an insulation layer to provide electronic connection to the battery cell.
