		A computer-implemented method for automatically sharing media between users is provided. A first image is received depicting a scene with one or more persons. Face detection information is identified for each person in the first image. Identification information for each face detected is obtained without user intervention. The face detection information and the identification information are associated with the first image. The first image including the associated face detection information and identification information is sent to a server hosting a media sharing service. An access link to an event group is received. The event group includes an album of the first image and a first collection of images that share a set of common features with the first image.
