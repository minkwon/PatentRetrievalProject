	<str name="Title">
		System and method for biological wastewater treatment and for using the byproduct thereof
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A wastewater treatment system and process includes a treatment system for biologically treating wastewater to produce substantially clean water effluent and byproducts. The treatment system includes an array of rotating media wheels for sustained algae growth. The media wheels are supported so that the algae rotates into and out of the wastewater for exposure to sunlight. One byproduct is algae removed from the rotating media wheels, which may be provided to other processing facilities to produce, for instance, bio-diesel fuel. Waste CO.sub.2 may also be provided to the facility for enhanced algae growth. Bacteria is provided to form a symbiotic relationship with the algae, fueled by sunlight to effectively remove toxic materials from the wastewater. Rotation of the media wheels can be accomplished by air jets that also operate to dislodge excess algae as a byproduct of the system and process.
