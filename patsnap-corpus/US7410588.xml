	<str name="Abstract">
		A process for purifying a liquid from a dissolved solute includes the exposure of the liquid to a material absorbing the liquid in preference to the dissolved solute. The dissolved solute is adsorbed onto the material. Through exposure of the dissolved solute adsorbed on said material to output of an ionization source, solute release from the material occurs. Purification of the liquid to remove the dissolved solute occurs through the release of the liquid from said material separate from the release of the dissolved solute. A system for purifying a liquid from a dissolved solute includes a super absorbent polymer within a housing. A pH source is provided to released purified absorbed liquid portion A via a first outlet in the housing for collecting the released absorbed liquid portion A. An ionization source releases solute absorbed liquid portion B that is collected as a solute rich adsorbed liquid portion B.
