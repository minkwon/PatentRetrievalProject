		Systems and methods for combining and converting solid and liquid organic waste materials into useful products
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Systems and methods are provided for converting organic waste materials from a municipal waste stream to useful products, such as fuels. Through the use of a biomixer and a hydropulper, as well as through sorting and screening, the organic waste materials are progressively reduced in size and cleaned of contamination. The resulting uniform biomass is suitable for anaerobic digestion to produce biogas and a residual solid that is suitable for producing a high quality compost. A quantity of liquid organic waste material can be added to the biomixer, to the hydropulper and/or to the anaerobic digester. The quantity of liquid organic waste material can be obtained by separating the liquids from any containers and can be stored in a holding tank prior to being added to the biomixer, the hydropulper and/or the anaerobic digester.
