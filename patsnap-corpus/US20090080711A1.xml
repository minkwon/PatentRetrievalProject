		APPARATUS, METHOD, AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT FOR DETECTING OBJECT FROM IMAGE
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A storage unit stores therein features and reliabilities of respective first segment regions divided from a first region. An object extracting unit extracts a second region including an object from input image data. A reliability calculating unit calculates reliabilities of respective second segment regions divided from the second region. A feature calculating unit calculates features of the respective second segment regions. A similarity calculating unit calculates an object similarity by performing multiplication of: segment similarities between the features of the first segment regions divided from the first region and the features of the second segment regions; and reliabilities of the respective segment regions, and then by summing up obtained values from the multiplication. A determining unit determines that an object included in the first region matches an object included in the second region when the object similarity is greater than a threshold.
