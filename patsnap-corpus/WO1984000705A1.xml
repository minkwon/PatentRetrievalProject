		COMPOSITE PACKAGE AND SOLVENTLESS ASSEMBLY THEREOF
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Composite package (44), method and apparatus for assembling and using said package. There are commercially available receptacles for packaging an article within a semi-rigid container conforming closely to the shape and size of the article. These containers comprise a container member or bubble with a closure member or lid attached by means of a bonding agent. Typically, the bonding agent is applied by conventional means over substantially the entire surface of at least one side of the closure member. This results in inefficient use of the bonding agent and may prevent the usage of said package in sensitive areas such as packaging of medical related items. The present invention applies a bonding agent (32) to only the portion (24) of the closure (21) that will actually be sealed. This is accomplished by depositing finely divided, electrostatically chargeable bonding agent particles (32) onto the closure member (21), after which said member is juxtaposed with respect to the container member (25) such that the bonding particles (32) overlie the assembly lip (39), after which the bonding agent is heated to thereby adhere both members (21, 25) together.
