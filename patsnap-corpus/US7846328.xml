		Treatment system for enhanced water and wastewater nutrient removal
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Disclosed is a wastewater treatment apparatus utilizing time tested techniques for recirculating media treatment with proprietary advancements to produce a system capable of nitrifying and denitrifying wastewater through the use of passive calcium carbonate and organic carbon feed systems. By creating aerobic and anaerobic zones and the ability to monitor and adjust these zones by physical and mechanical means with minimal operator involvement, wastewater is recycled through these zones thereby creating an enhanced biological filtering process. The treated wastewater is then discharged to standard leaching facilities, various irrigation uses and/or introduced to further treatment for water recycling and reuse.
