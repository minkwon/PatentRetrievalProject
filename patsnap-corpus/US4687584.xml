		Sludge remover and processor
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A sludge remover and processor includes a first vessel holding cleaning liquid and a second, phase separating vessel. Cleaning liquid from the first vessel is sprayed against a dirty surface. A vacuum pump keeps the second vessel upper region at a partial vacuum so cleaning liquid and dislodged matter from the dirty surface is sucked into the second vessel. Solids and liquid are pumped from the second vessel into a solids separator where the larger solids are removed for disposal and liquid is pumped into a centrifuge which removes fine solid particles. The fine particles are mixed with a bulk solidification medium for disposal. Oil collection in the vessels is enhanced by the partial vacuum which lowers the boiling point so tiny bubbles are formed to aid separation of the oily and non-oily phases. Passing the liquid through a centrifuge also aids separation of the oily and non-oily phases in the first vessel.
