		Battery locking apparatus for electronic device
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A locking apparatus for a battery (10) having locking portions (11) includes a base (20), a resilient member (85) secured to the base, and a first lock member (40). The resilient member includes a stop portion (86). The first lock member defines a first recess (43) and a second recess (42), and includes at least one post (51). The at least one post is engaged in the locking portions of the battery. The first lock member is slidable between a first position and a second position. When the first lock member is slid to the first position, the stop potion of the resilient member abuts the first lock member in the first recess to secure the battery to the base. When the first lock member is slid to the second position, the stop potion abuts the first lock member in the second recess to release the battery from the base.
