	<str name="Title">
		Water treatment by dendrimer enhanced filtration
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Described herein are compositions and methods useful for the purification of water using dendritic macromolecules. The process involves using dendritic macromolecules (dendrimers) to bind to contaminants, and a filtration step to produce water from which contaminants have been removed or modified. Examples of dendrimers that may be used in the process include cation-binding dendrimers, anion-binding dendrimers, organic compound-binding dendrimers, redox-active dendrimers, biological compound-binding dendrimers, catalytic dendrimers, biocidal dendrimers, viral-binding dendrimers, multi-functional dendrimers, and combinations thereof. The process is readily scalable and provides many options for customization.
