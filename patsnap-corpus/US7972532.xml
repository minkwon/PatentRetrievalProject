	<str name="Title">
		Composition for odor control
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A synergistic composition is provided for controlling odor from waste products. The composition comprises a combination of nitrate salt, sulfide-consuming compound, pH-elevating compound, sulfide-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing bacteria, and sulfide-oxidizing enzyme. The method includes adding a sufficient amount of the composition to a waste stream to provide sufficient sulfide-consuming compound to effect immediate removal of sulfide. The composition incorporates a pH elevating compound, which both decreases the amount of gaseous H.sub.2S and puts the aqueous phase into a pH range where naturally occurring bacteria can more easily metabolize the sulfide. The composition also includes one or more nitrate salts which will accomplish longer term prevention of odors. Specific bacteria are incorporated into the formulation to insure that the nitrate has the right type and amount of bacteria present to prevent formation of and/or consume sulfide. Specific enzymes are incorporated into the formulation to promote oxidation of sulfide.
