	<str name="Abstract">
		A water treatment equipment has a raw water tank as a mixing section, a micronanobubble generation tank, a floatation tank, and a treated water tank. Waste water as treatment water is introduced into the raw water tank and mixed with the water containing micronanobubbles produced by the micronanobubble generation tank. Thereafter, the waste water, as treatment water, is introduced into a lower mixing section of the floatation tank from the raw tank by a raw water tank pump. Also, treatment water containing fine bubbles is introduced into the lower mixing section from a pressure tank. Therefore, the micronanobubbles is mixed with the fine bubbles in the lower mixing section of the floatation tank, thereby almost all the suspended matter in the treatment water is surfaced. Thus, the water treatment equipment enhances separatability of suspended matter.
