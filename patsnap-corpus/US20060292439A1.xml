The battery cover latching assembly includes a locking portion (114), a resisting portion (342), and a latch (40). The locking portion is formed on the first cover. The resisting portion is formed on the second cover. The latch is attached to the housing and abutting the resisting portion. The latch includes an engaging portion (44) and a button portion (42).
