	<str name="Abstract">
		An enclosure or casing that will contain a rechargeable battery which can be inserted from the side. An adapter and a battery recharge socket is attached to the side of the casing allowing for stored power. The back panel has AC type sockets which will operate anything that use AC power. The carry handle provides a means to transport the unit from place to place. An on and off switch allows the pack to be used at chosen times. An inverter circuit is applied inside to change the source of power form DC to AC. The base is square to allow user to position the unit without tilting. The difference in the design is the capability of changing DC current to AC current.
