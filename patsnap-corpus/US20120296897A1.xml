		Text to Image Translation
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Techniques are described for online real time text to image translation suitable for virtually any submitted query. Semantic classes and associated analogous items for each of the semantic classes are determined for the submitted query. One or more requests are formulated that are associated with analogous items. The requests are used to obtain web based images and associated surrounding text. The web based images are used to obtain associated near-duplicate images. The surrounding text of images is analyzed to create high-quality text associated with each semantic class of the submitted query. One or more query dependent classifiers are trained online in real time to remove noisy images. A scoring function is used to score the images. The images with the highest score are returned as a query response.
