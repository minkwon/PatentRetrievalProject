		Methods and devices for separating liquid components
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Methods and devices for preparing a solid-fibrin web are provided. One method may include drawing blood from a patient, separating plasma from the blood, contacting the plasma with a calcium-coagulation activator and concurrently coagulating and axially centrifuging the plasma to form the solid-fibrin web. The solid-fibrin web may be suitable for regenerating body tissue in a living organism. Devices used in the methods may also be provided.
