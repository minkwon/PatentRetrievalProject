	<str name="Abstract">
		The disclosure provides an electronic device having back-up power during battery replacement. The electronic device includes a body, a printed circuit board (PCB) mounted in the body, and an electrode assembly connected to the PCB. The body defines an accommodating space. The electrode assembly may rotate relative to the body and further comprises at least two groups of contacts aligned in different rotation orientations. The accommodating space is configured to accommodate a first battery. A first group of the at least two groups of contacts is engaged with the first battery, the at least two groups of contacts are connected in parallel to the PCB, when the first battery is being replaced by a second battery, the first group of contacts is kept engaged with the first battery, and a second group of the at least two groups of contacts is engaged with the second battery.
