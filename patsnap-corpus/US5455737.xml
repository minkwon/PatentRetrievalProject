	<str name="Abstract">
		A portable computer has a housing in which a storing section is formed. The storing section has an opening which is opened to a top face of the housing between a keyboard and a top rear end portion of the housing. A battery pack is fitted in the storing section and is detachable from the storing section through the opening. The battery pack has a top face which forms a pan of the top face of the housing. A strip-like holding groove, for receiving a strip-like function label, is formed on the top face of the housing and the top face of the battery pack. A display unit is attached to the housing so as to be rotatable between a closed position in which the display unit covers the keyboard and the opening of the storing section and an opened position in which the keyboard and the top face of the detachable unit are exposed. Display unit supports are attached to the rear end portion of the top face of the housing.
