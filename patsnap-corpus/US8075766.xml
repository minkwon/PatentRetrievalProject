	<str name="Abstract">
		A water treatment method is provided for helping to partially or completely remove sodium and methane gas from water. In the method, water is combined with a reactant that is formulated to combine with the sodium in the water and form a compound. The water and compound are then passed through a bed of media for helping to separate the compound from the water. The method also includes aerating the water to release gases contained therein by breaking the water into microdroplets by passing it through a screen. Additionally, the method may include a step wherein the water is passed through an acidic resin for facilitating a cation exchange where additional sodium is removed. A water treatment apparatus for performing the method is also provided.
