		LIQUID SPRAYING SYSTEM FOR FINE MISTING AND HUMIDIFICATION
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A liquid spraying system for maintaining a predetermined amount of moisture in an environment, particularly suited for use on produce displayed in a produce display. The system operates in a manner that purposely introduces air into liquid flowing through the system to ultimately spray a fine mist into an environment. The use of a venturi injector in a preferred embodiment allows for the introduction of air into the system while eliminating the need for an added air compressor. The uniform mixture of air and water then flows through a liquid pump, and alternatively an expansion tank, and can be delivered to one or more nozzle assemblies at a predetermined pressure. The air liquid mixture exits nozzles in mist form that has small liquid droplets forming a fine mist which is propelled outward from the nozzle. In alternate embodiments, liquid flowing through the system that does not initially exit through the nozzles can be recirculated through the system by a return line that allows the non-sprayed mist liquid to flow back through the system and be recycled.
