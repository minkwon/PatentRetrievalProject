	<str name="Title">
		System for mineral hardness management
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		The disclosed systems and methods for maintenance of an enclosed body of water generally include mobile systems and/or methods for removal of mineral hardness and other particulate impurities via lime softening filtration. Chemicals are added to a body of water containing unwanted mineral hardness (or other particulate impurities) and mixed to assist dispersion. The chemicals react with the hardness minerals making them insoluble. The resulting precipitate falls out of solution to the bottom of the body of water for subsequent removal via filtration. This eliminates or otherwise reduces the need for draining water and/or adding new water to a body of water to maintain proper mineral hardness balance and/or concentration of other particulate impurities.
