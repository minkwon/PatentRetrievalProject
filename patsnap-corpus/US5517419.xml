	<str name="Abstract">
		A tractor and trailer together with a post-processing system that uses GPS satellites together with a dead reckoning system and associated cameras and sensors to determine the exact location of the system, translating this location information onto several photogrammetric mapping collectors for the purposes of developing an orthographic database image that can be correlated with other onboard sensors for determining the precise location of terrain features. The main sensor platform comprises a GPS receiver together with a plurality of visual sensors and a dead reckoning system mounted on a trailer. The GPS data and the dead reckoning data are brought together in a navigation system to provide precise location of the system. The camera system on board the trailer of the system comprises a series of cameras for recording images of the terrain as the trailer proceeds over the terrain of interest. During data collection, digital imagery is transmitted from each camera and received by an on-board computer. The collection of image data is triggered by the movement of the vehicle a certain distance along the ground. Simultaneously with the collection of the digital image data, the on-board GPS system and dead reckoning system are queried for geographical reference. A dataframe is then created and stored for each form of imagery from each camera. During post processing, an operator can extract highly accurate geographic coordinates from a combination of photogrammetric techniques using the stored images and geographic data. The system outputs hardcopy engineering plots and softcopy digital vector files.
