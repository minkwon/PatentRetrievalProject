	<str name="Title">
		Bacterial cultivation system for growth of substrate specific micro-organisms for use in industrial wastewater remediation
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A waste treatment method includes the concentration of selected strains of bacteria in a selected medium in the presence of nutrients and water, under aerobic conditions. This concentrated batch is thereafter discharged for downstream applications in wastewater remediation. The present invention employs a cultivation chamber having inlet ports and a circular vent port that allows for adequate air introduction and heat release. Aeration is achieved by recirculation of the fluid medium from the top of the apparatus through a pipe that runs the length of the inner wall and is specially configured at the top to minimize cell damage. Fluid can be routed tangentially in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions within the chamber. The conical bottom also has an orifice allowing for recirculation of the fluid medium tangentially to the sidewalls. Upon completion of the batch cultivation, the medium and bacteria are discharged for downstream applications in wastewater remediation of paper mill, chemical plant, oil refinery, and other industrial effluents. The aeration and circulation of the fluids is designed to limit cells shearing and damage yet achieve critical cell mass (e.g. between 10.sup.7 and 10.sup.10 cfu (colony forming units) per milliliter (ml)) and dissolved oxygen uptake rates (e.g. between about 50 and 1500) during cultivation.
