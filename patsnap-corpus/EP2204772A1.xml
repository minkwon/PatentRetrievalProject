	<str name="Abstract">
		An object of the present invention is to detect motion between plural images with high precision without increasing the number of blocks made by dividing an image. Thus, an image-processing method according to the present invention is characterized by including a searching step (S3) of searching for a local motion vector from each of blocks in the plural images, an electing step (S4) of electing a representative motion vector from the local motion vectors of the respective blocks, and an approximating step (S5) of approximating a motion vector distribution on the images based on the representative motion vector. In addition, when an approximate surface thereof is a plane, the operation amount for approximating the motion vector distribution and the information amount for representing the motion vector distribution can be minimized.
