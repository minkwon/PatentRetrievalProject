	<str name="Title">
		Process for removal of impurities from mother liquor in the synthesis of carboxylic acid using pressure filtration
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A process is disclosed that relates to the recovery of a metal catalyst from an oxidizer purge stream produced in the synthesis of carboxylic acid, typically terephthalic. More particularly, the process involves recovery of a metal catalyst from an oxidizer purge stream through the use of a pressure filter, the combining of water with a mother liquor to recover the metal catalyst and then subjecting an aqueous mixture so formed to a single stage extraction with an extraction solvent to produce an extract stream comprising organic impurities and a raffinate stream comprising the metal catalyst.
