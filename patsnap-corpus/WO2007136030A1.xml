		FINE BUBBLE GENERATING APPARATUS
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		This invention provides a fine bubble generating apparatus which can efficiently generate fine bubbles on a nano level. This apparatus comprises a cylindrical member (40) having a cylindrical inner peripheral face, a first end wall member (42) set so as to close one end of the cylindrical member, and a second end wall member (44) set so as to close the other end of the cylindrical member. The cylindrical member (40), the first end wall member (42), and the second end wall member (44) define a fluid swirling chamber (46). A fluid introduction hole (48) for supplying a gas-liquid mixed fluid into the tangential direction of the peripheral face of the fluid swirling chamber (46) is provided at a position close to the second end wall member (44) in the cylindrical member. A fluid delivery hole (50) passed through a central axial line of the inner peripheral face of the fluid swirling chamber is further provided in the second end wall member. The gas-liquid mixed fluid is introduced into the fluid swirling chamber at a position close to the second end wall member, and most of the fluid is directed toward the first end wall member while swirling along the inner peripheral face of the fluid swirling chamber, is reversed and directed toward the second end wall member, and is discharged through a fluid delivery hole.
