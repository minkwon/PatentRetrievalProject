		Portable electronic device with operation mode determined in accordance with power consumption and method thereof
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A portable electronic device with an operation mode determined in accordance with power consumption and an operation mode switching method thereof are proposed. The method examines the voltage required by different systems to control every power system independently. By examining the capacity of a battery cell unit and comparing the capacity result with a first reference capacity and a second reference capacity, whether to offer operation power in order to operate a mobile communication module or a digital camera module is determined. Therefore, when a digital camera module, which has high power consumption requirements, is off, the mobile communication module can still operate to effectively use energy provided by the power supply unit.
