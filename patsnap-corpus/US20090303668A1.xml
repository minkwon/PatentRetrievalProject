	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A battery cover latching mechanism used in portable electronic device (10) is described including a cover member (11), a housing member (12), a latch base (14), a latch member (13), and a return member (15). The latch base can be securely attached to the housing member. The latch member is mounted on the latch base and movable relative to the latch base to latch the cover member to the housing member. The return member is compressed when the cover member is latched to the housing member.
