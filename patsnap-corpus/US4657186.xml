		Stream former

	<str name="Abstract">
		A new and improved stream former is provided for attachment to the discharge end of a faucet or the like. The stream issuing from the stream former provides a formed, coherent, non-splash, silent, gentle flow. The stream former includes a sleeve-like casing, of metal or plastic, with an upstream attachment means, and a pair of axially spaced inwardly projecting supports defined on the inner wall of the sleeve-like casing, downstream of the attachment means. A transverse, fine-mesh, support screen is supported on the downstream support. A plastic, cup-shaped, molded transverse member is supported on the upstream support. A plurality of transverse, axial flow holes are provided through the apertured transverse wall of the cup-shaped transverse member. A closely woven, non-shedding, foraminous mat of nylon fibers is positioned between said transverse wall of the upper transverse member and the fine-mesh screen support. The ratio of downstream outlet area of the stream former to area of discharge through the upstream apertured transverse wall is about 30:1. The discharge from the stream former is silent and provides a coherent stream that is silky to the touch, and discharges less than 2.75 g.p.m. at an upstream feed pressure of 85 PSI.
