		Method and apparatus for treatment of contaminated liquid
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Methods and apparatuses for treatment of contaminated liquid are provided including an integrated ultra-filtration and clarification apparatus, and an optional integrated electrocoagulation capability. The integrated apparatus comprises an outer tank, an inner casing, and a plurality of ultra-filtration filters contained within the inner casing. Clarification of liquid occurs in the gap between the casing and tank. Solid matter settles, and aggregates in the bottom portion of the tank. The accumulated solid material acts as a secondary filter by pre-filtering the liquid prior to contact with the ultra-filtration filters. Clarified liquid is retained in a chamber of the casing, and the clarified liquid is drawn through the ultra-filtration filters as initiated by a source of vacuum communicating with the ultra-filtration filters. The integrated apparatus can be incorporated within any desired liquid treatment facility, and one combination in accordance with this system of the present invention includes an upstream electrocoagulation unit and a downstream reverse osmosis unit. The electrocoagulation function may be incorporated in the tank by a plurality of reaction plates or blades mounted to the interior sidewall of the tank. Additionally, the integrated apparatuses may include bacterial treatment in which a selected group of micro-organisms are introduced into the apparatus for treatment of particular contaminates.
