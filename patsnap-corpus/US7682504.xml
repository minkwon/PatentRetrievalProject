		System for growing crustaceans and other fish
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A recirculated marine aquaculture system for growing crustaceans within a body of water includes a wholly submerged chamber situated in the body of water having a filtering wall connecting the chamber floor and ceiling permitting water to flow from the water body into the first chamber while excluding particulate materials. A second chamber is situated above the first chamber having a plurality of water outlets below the body of water upper surface, and a top having an air inlet above the body of water upper surface. A stand pipe has an open lower end opening into the first chamber and a plurality of laterally directed openings into the top of the second chamber. An impeller coupled to the stand pipe moves filtered water from the first chamber through the laterally directed openings into the second chamber adjacent to the air inlet, the water exiting the second chamber into the body of water through the plurality of water outlets after mixing with air drawn in through the air inlet.
