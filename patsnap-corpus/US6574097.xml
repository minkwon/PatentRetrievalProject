	<str name="Abstract">
		A computer includes a body having a module bay formed therein. A module is removably mounted in the bay. A latch actuator is mounted on the module for movement between a first position and a second position. A first movable catch member extends from a first surface of the module into engagement with the body of the computer and a second movable catch member extends from a second surface of the module into engagement with the body of the computer. A first flexible member interconnects the first catch member and the latch actuator. A second flexible member interconnects the second catch member and the latch actuator. As a result, movement of the latch actuator from the first position to the second position, moves the first and second flexible members and retracts the first and second catch members out of engagement with the body of the computer.
