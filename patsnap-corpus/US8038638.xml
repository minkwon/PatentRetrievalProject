	<str name="Abstract">
		An extracorporeal circuit for removing toxins from the blood and plasma volume control in patients suffering from sepsis and renal failure. The extracorporeal circuit disclosed herein comprises a plasma filter, a toxin removal device and optionally a hemofilter that minimizes electrolyte and protein depletion from the treated plasma while effectively removing both free and protein-bound toxins. The toxin removal device comprises adsorbent materials selected from the group consisting of activated carbon, ion exchange resins and non-ionic exchange resins and the adsorbent materials are coated with albumin. Also provided are associated methods for treating patients suffering from sepsis and renal failure using the disclosed extracorporeal circuit and toxin removal device.
