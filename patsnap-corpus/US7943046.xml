		Methods and systems for on-column protein delipidation
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Embodiments of the present invention provide a method of chromatographic delipidation comprising separating a lipid-containing sample on a superficially porous stationary phase at greater than about 70.degree. C., at least about 80.degree. C., having at least one mobile phase comprising an ion-pairing agent in water, an ion-pairing agent in an organic modifier, an acid in an organic modifier, and an alcohol. The invention provides minimal protein losses and high run-to-run reproducibility. The on-column delipidation method aventageously utilize reversed phase liquid chromatography.
