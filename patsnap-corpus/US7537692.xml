		Self-cleaning aquarium and associated method
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A self-cleaning aquarium includes a container for receiving and housing water includes a wall having a plurality of apertures formed therein. A corrugated base member has juxtaposed crests and troughs and is removably positioned within the container. The troughs are abutted against one wall and linearly aligned with the apertures respectively. The base member is intercalated between a filter screen and a bottom wall of the container respectively and includes walls spanning from the bottom wall of the container to the filter screen. The filter screen is removably positioned directly on the base member and is situated above the apertures. A plurality of valves are operably coupled to the apertures and are in fluid communication with the cavity. Such valves are independently adapted between open and closed positions for channeling bacteria and debris out from the container while filled with water.
