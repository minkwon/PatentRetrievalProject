	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A facility for treating solid and liquid waste includes a receiving station, a screening station, a preprocessing station, a press station and a processing station. The screening station is connected to an inlet capable of receiving liquid and solid waste and includes a screen for capturing at least some of the solid waste. The preprocessing station is in fluid communication with the screening station, and includes a degrit chamber for settling out an additional amount of the solids. The press station included at least one alkali mixing tank and a screw press for separating out an additional portion of the solids. The processing station includes at least one aerobic microorganism generating unit for converting nitrites into nitrogen gas and consuming carbon-based waste material.
