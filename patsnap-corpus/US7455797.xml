		Method and apparatus for producing particles using supercritical fluid
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		The present invention provides a method of producing particles via a supercritical fluid processing technique, an apparatus for carrying out the method and the particles produced thereby. The method includes: (1) providing: a supercritical fluid; a first solvent that is soluble in the supercritical fluid; a second solvent that is substantially insoluble in the supercritical fluid and is at least partially soluble in or miscible with the first solvent; and a solute that is soluble in the first solvent and is substantially insoluble in the second solvent and the supercritical fluid; (2) contacting the first solvent, the second solvent and the solute together to form a solution; and (3) contacting the solution with the supercritical fluid to extract the first solvent from the solution and precipitate the solute in the form of particles that are suspended in the second solvent.
