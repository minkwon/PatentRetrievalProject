		Floating aquatic plant culture systems and associated methods
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A floating plant culture system has improved strength and durability and includes a substantially planar platform having a length along opposed sides thereof and a width along front and back thereof generally perpendicular to the sides. The platform is adapted for growing a culture of attached plants including micro- and macrophytes thereon. Beneath the platform are affixed a plurality of cells extending in bridging relation to the sides and open at each end adjacent the sides. The cells are placeable in fluid communication with a body of water desired to be remediated. Affixed along at least a portion of the sides extend a pair of opposed hollow beams, for providing flotation to the platform. The beams are also placeable in fluid communication with the body of water, and an upper surface of the platform is floodable by the body of water from beneath for submerging plants attached thereto.
