		Washing machine equipped with means for generating microbubbles of air

	<str name="Abstract">
		Disclosed is an improved washing machine equipped with means for generating microbubbles of air in the detergent-containing water circulated from and to the stationary outer tub of the washing machine. Disclosed means for generating microbubbles of air in the detergent-containing water circulated therethrough comprises: (a) an upstream detergent-containing water guide tube connected to the bottom portion of the stationary outer tub; (b) strainer means for filtering out fiber and other foreign object materials contained in the detergent-containing water, which is connected to the upstream water guide tube; (c) air-bubble introducing/feeding means into the detergent-containing water, which is connected to the strainer means; (d) a high-speed single-stage type or multi-stage type pump for generating microbubbles of air; (e) a motor coupled to the pump; (f) a plenum for the mixture of the microbubbles of air and the detergent-containing water under pressure; (g) a pressure-regulator valve for buildup of pressure for the mixture in the plenum; and (h) a downstream microbubble-containing water guide tube connected between the pressure-regulator valve and the outer tub so that the detergent-containing water in the outer tub is circulated therethrough as far as the pump is in operation; whereby each of the air bubbles introduced by suction or pressure feeding into the detergent-containing water through the air-bubble introducing means either by suction or by pressure feeding is dynamically broken into a plurality of microbubbles of air by the leading edge of rotor and/or stator blade of either high-speed single-stage or multi-stage pump.
