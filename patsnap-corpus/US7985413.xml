	<str name="Title">
		Microbiological control in aqueous systems
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Microbiological control is achieved by continuously and inexpensively dosing water in contact with biofilm, or that comes into contact with biofilm, using a highly effective biocide that provides very effective microbiocidal control of planktonic microorganisms and of biofilm species, even where the biofilm infestations have been in existence for long periods of time and thus have encased themselves in a substantial quantity of slimy defensive polysaccharide layers or films. In addition, the biocide used makes possible significant reduction in copper and/or iron surfaces in contact with the water as compared to N,N'-bromochloro-5,5-dimethyl hydantoin. Still other advantages are made possible by the described technology.
