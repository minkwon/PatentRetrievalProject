		Method of purifying polluted water
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		In a first treatment step part of at least one difficulty biodegradable or non-biodegradable organic compound is oxidized in polluted water by bringing said polluted water into contact with an ozone containing gas. The effluent is subsequently diluted with an aqueous liquid before a second treatment with ozone is carried out. If the concentration of the organic compound is still not sufficiently low, the treated effluent is diluted again and subjected to a further treatment with ozone. It was found that a more effective ozone treatment was obtained by the dilution or dilutions and that in particular no pH control was needed, so that no formation of additional salts occurred.
