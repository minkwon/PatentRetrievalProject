		Thermally controlled equipment cabinet
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A thermally controlled equipment cabinet for telephone systems has a gas-tight, sealed compartment for mounting sensitive active electronic components and has jacket 20 partially encompassing at least three sides of the sealed compartment. The sealed compartment utilizes either forced or natural convection to dissipate the heat generated by the components to the surrounding air. The heat is then dissipated to the ambient air through a highly heat-conductive corrugated roof and side panels. The jacket provides a cooling air passage around the sealed compartment and over the corrugated roof removing heat thereof. Nonsensitive passive components, mounted in the cooling air passage near the air inlet of the jacket, provide protrusions in the cooling air passage causing a slightly turbulent air flow in the passage thereby enhancing heat transfer. Storage batteries, such as used in telephone systems, are mounted within the cooling air passage near the air exhaust of the jacket. The warmer air allows the batteries operate at higher and more efficient operating temperatures.
