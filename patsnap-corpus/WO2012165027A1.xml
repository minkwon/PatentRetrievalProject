	<str name="Title">
		METHOD FOR CLEANING AND DECONTAMINATING INSIDE STRUCTURE CONTAMINATED BY RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCE, AND CLEANING AND DECONTAMINATION DEVICE VEHICLE
	</str>

	<str name="Abstract">
		Provided is a method for decontaminating the inside of a structure contaminated by radioactive substances, that removes contamination of floor and wall surfaces and ceilings, etc., inside the structure contaminated by the radioactive substances, using reduced water as cleaning water, and purifies and makes reusable waste water used in the decontamination. The method has: a cleaning stage in which the reduced water negatively charged at a potential of -400 - -600 mV is scattered on the decontamination-target object contaminated by the radioactive substances and brushing occurs; a cleaning waste water recovery stage in which the cleaning waste water is recovered; a filtration stage in which the cleaning waste water is sent to a filter and the coarse-grained solid component thereof is filtered; a first adsorption stage in which the cleaning waste water is caused to pass through a column filled with a mixture of hydrogen ion-saturated clay and alum or a column filled with a hydrogen ion-saturated cation-exchange resin, and cationic radioactive substances in the cleaning waste water are adsorbed and removed; a second adsorption stage in which the cleaning waste water is caused to pass through a column filled with a hydroxide ion-saturated anion-exchange resin and anionic radioactive substances in the cleaning waste water are adsorbed and removed; a third adsorption stage in which the cleaning waste water is caused to pass through a column filled with zeolite and residual radioactive substances in the cleaning waste water are removed; and a microbubble processing stage in which the cleaning waste water is processed using air microbubbles and returned to water having high biological activity.
