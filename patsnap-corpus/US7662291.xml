		Canister for treatment of contaminated fluids
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		An apparatus for use in the treatment of contaminated fluid is provided. The apparatus includes an outer element into which contaminated fluid flows and an inner element positioned in substantial axial alignment within the outer element and in spaced relations thereto. The apparatus also includes, between its ends, a pathway defined by an interior surface of the inner element and along which treated fluid may be directed out from the apparatus. A waste nanoadsorbent material can be provided between the outer element and the inner element, for use in removing contaminants within the fluid flowing through the apparatus. A method for the treatment of contaminated fluid is also provided.
