		Battery Cover Grounding Device for Portable Terminal
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A battery cover grounding device for a portable terminal including a metallic battery cover is provided. The grounding device includes a grounding member installed on the terminal to be connected to a grounding surface of the terminal and to be in contact with the battery cover. The grounding member has a cover protrusion formed on the battery cover and a grounding protrusion attached to the terminal to contact the cover protrusion. In this manner, the metallic battery cover is connected to the grounding surface of the terminal to minimize the possibility of current leakage, to improve the stability of the operation of the terminal, and to minimize potential malfunctions of the terminal due to static electricity.
