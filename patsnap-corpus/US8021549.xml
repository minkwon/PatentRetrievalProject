		Method and apparatus for producing potable water from seawater using forward osmosis
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method and apparatus for desalinating seawater which uses an ammonia bicarbonate forward osmosis desalination process. Seawater is pumped through one side of a membrane assembly. A draw solution is pumped through the other side of the membrane assembly. The draw solution withdraws water molecules from the seawater through the membrane into the draw solution. A draw solution separator receives a heated draw solution which then decomposes into ammonia, carbon dioxide and water. Potable water is separated from ammonia has and carbon dioxide gas. The ammonia gas and carbon dioxide gas are recombined with a portion of the potable water stream to reform the ammonium bicarbonate draw solution.
