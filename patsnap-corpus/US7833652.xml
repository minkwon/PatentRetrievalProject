		Battery loading mechanism and electronic apparatus
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A battery loading mechanism includes: a battery loading section having an insertion space capable for accommodating a battery, in which a portion of an outer circumference of each of two end surfaces on insertion and ejection sides, respectively, is formed as a curve section; and lock means for locking the battery loaded into the battery loading section, the lock means rotatably supported on the battery loading section. The lock means includes a lock section, the lock section being formed in such a shape that it becomes wider the further away it is from a point at which the lock means is rotatably supported, and at least a portion of a side edge of the lock section in a width direction is formed as a curve section corresponding to the curve section of the battery.
