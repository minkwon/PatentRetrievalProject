		Fluid diffuser

	<str name="Abstract">
		A diffuser for air or other fluids has a rigid body with an upper disc portion having a series of radially projecting fingers about its perimeter. The fingers are relatively narrow and blunt. A diaphragm formed of a soft elastomer has a rim portion which receives the fingers. The diaphragm overlies the disc and normally closes a central opening in the body. Spaces at the base of the fingers are not covered by the rim portion of the diaphragm and air or other fluid escapes through those spaces when it is admitted under pressure through the central opening in the body. A circular cylindrical wall depends from beneath the disc at the bases of the teeth to discourage the fluid from collecting beneath the disc. In another embodiment, the spaces through which the fluid passes are covered by an open cell foam in the form of a ring that surrounds the wall and that is held in place against the rim portion by a plate mounted to the body and seated against the bottom of the wall. The fluid is forced through the foam to exit as fine bubbles.
