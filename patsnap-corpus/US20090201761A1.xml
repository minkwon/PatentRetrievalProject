	<str name="Abstract">
		There are provided a fluid injection nozzle, a fluid mixer, a microbubble generating apparatus, a vapor phase generating apparatus, a method of producing swirling flow, and a swirling flow producing apparatus that can be applied to any kind of fluid and can efficiently generate a swirling flow at high speed. The swirling flow producing apparatus includes a housing and a cylindrical member. The housing includes a cylindrical portion of which at least one end is opened, and a fluid introducing passage that is opened on an inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical portion. The cylindrical member is provided in the cylindrical portion of the housing. The cylindrical member includes a cylindrical portion of which at least one end in a direction corresponding to an opening direction of the cylindrical portion is opened, and holes formed in a peripheral wall of the cylindrical portion. A fluid introduced from the fluid introducing passage flows into the cylindrical portion of the cylindrical member through the holes so as to generate a swirling flow, and flows out from the housing and the cylindrical member.
