		An aquarium is provided that hides ugly electrical wires. The aquarium comprises: a tank capable of holding water, the tank having an interior and an exterior, and a bottom, the bottom having an opening within the interior of the tank, a hollow member disposed within at least the interior of the tank and having an upper opening, a lower opening, an inner surface and an outer surface, the lower opening capable of aligning around or with the opening in the bottom of the tank so that water is prevented from leaking out the opening in the bottom of the tank, the outer surface of the hollow member capable of preventing water flow into the inner surface of the hollow member, and the inner surface of the hollow member capable of receiving one or more electrical wires to or from the upper and lower openings of the hollow member. In various embodiments, a decorative structure is provided that can hide and protect electrical devices typically used in the aquarium. In other embodiments, the tank has a top base that conceals an aquarium light.
