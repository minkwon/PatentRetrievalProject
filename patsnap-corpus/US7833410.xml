		Bio tank/gas replenishment system
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		In systems for treating wastewater liquid by utilizing aerobic biological species, the contaminated wastewater stream is pretreated in a dissolved air flotation system to remove suspended solid waste, including large particles such as fats, grease, and physically emulsified oils. The purified wastewater containing dissolved waste is thereafter gasified and further decontaminated in a bioreactor tank. Biological species in the bioreactor tank consume gas and perform bodily functions that converts dissolved waste into easily removable carbon dioxide and suspend solids. Gas consumed by the biological species is replenished by pumping the wastewater though a liquid-gas mixer. A controller regulates the speed of the pump based on real-time gas concentration measurements provided by a corresponding gas probe disposed within the wastewater in the bioreactor tank.
