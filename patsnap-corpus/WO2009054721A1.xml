	<str name="Title">
		TRACKING SYSTEM FOR MOVING OBJECTS, USUALLY ANIMALS, MAINLY MIGRATORY BIRDS AND IN PARTICULAR CARRIER PIGEONS
	</str>

	<str name="Abstract">
		The invention relates to a tracking system for tracking the position of moving objects, mainly animals and especially migratory birds and in particular carrier pigeons (11). The tracking system is based on an electronic device that is provided with a radio transceiver operating in the GSM network. By this means a unique identification code such as a telephone number or registration number can be atransmitted via the GSM network (16) to the server (15). As energy source, the electronic device uses a zinc-air battery that can be attached to or detached from the electronic device by a snap connection. It is worth noting that the electronic device can be switched on and off with the aid of an incorporated RFID chip when this is activated by an RFID scanner. The electronic device weighs less than 10 grams so that the bearer of the electronic device, for example, a carrier pigeon is hardly weighed down. The electronic device is water-tight. The chips in the electronic device are fabricated on a basis of hafnium and are interconnected by means of a wafer-level packaging technique.
