	<str name="Title">
		Method for the production of natural energy from waste
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		The method aims at obtaining from waste and more particularly from municipal solid waste (MSW) the energy contained therein at the highest level for industrial use by means of natural technologies and with low environmental impact. The method, denoted by the acronym NEW (Natural Energy from Waste) operates through the following process phases: a) aerobic digestion of the putrescible biological part to produce stabilized waste which is easy to handle, b) separation of a fraction rich in materials with a high heat value, c) storage of the residue, rich in biodegradable and inert substances, compacted into appropriate geometrical shapes in bioreactors which can be activated and sealed, d) activation of the bioreactors with water and their service in time during anaerobic digestion to supply biogas to be used for the production of energy, e) bio-stabilization and dehydration of the residual material of the anaerobic treatment with air, f) possible recovery of the materials produced in this way. In this way the energy contained in the waste, is extracted at the most refined level in the form of plastic, plastic/paper and methane for energy uses with maximum yield and reduced production of ash, and the end material leaving the bioreactors is fully exhausted of its energy content and inertised.
