		IMAGE RESOLUTION INCREASING METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE SAME
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		An image resolution increasing method includes reducing an input image, calculating a first feature vector having a feature quantity of a first block of a reduced image, extracting a high-frequency component image from the input image, storing pairs each having the first feature vector and a second block of the high-frequency component image that is located at the same position as the first block as a look-up table, enlarging the input image, calculating a second feature vector having a feature quantity of a third block of an object in the input image, searching the look-up table for the first feature vector similar to the second feature vector, and adding a fourth block of the look-up table which pairs with the first feature vector and a fifth block of the temporal enlarged image that is located at the same position as the third block.
