	<str name="Abstract">
		A nozzle for producing a gas microbubble-saturated stream of liquid from a stream of liquid supersaturated with gas comprises a chamber (1, 2, 3) having an inlet (8) for liquid and a flow channel connecting the inlet to an outlet for outflow of the liquid, the nozzle further incorporating a movable means (6) arranged for movement between a first position, where the means (6) co-operates with the body of the nozzle so as to form a restriction to the flow channel such that, in use, the passage through the restriction thus formed of a stream of liquid supersaturated with gas causes gas microbubbles to be formed in the liquid, and a second position, where the flow channel is unrestricted, the means (6) being biased towards the second position but arranged to be driven towards the first position by the force of a stream of liquid passed through the nozzle. &lt;IMAGE&gt;
