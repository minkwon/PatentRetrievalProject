		COMPACT MEDIA PLAYER
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		An electronic device such as a media player may be formed from electrical components such as integrated circuits, buttons, and a battery. Electrical input-output port contacts may be used to play audio and to convey digital signals. Electrical components for the device may be mounted to a substrate. The components may be encapsulated in an encapsulant and covered with an optional housing structure. The electrical input-output port contacts and portions of components such as buttons may remain uncovered by encapsulant during the encapsulation process. Integrated circuits may be entirely encapsulated with encapsulant. The integrated circuits may be packaged or unpackaged integrated circuit die. The substrate may be a printed circuit board or may be an integrated circuit to which components are directly connected without interposed printed circuit board materials.
