	<str name="Abstract">
		A position alignment method, a position alignment device, and a program in which processing load can be reduced are proposed. A group of some points in a first set of points extracted from an object appearing in one image and a group of some points in a second set of points extracted from an object appearing in another image are used as a reference, and the second set of points is aligned with respect to the first set of points. Thereafter, all the points in the first set of points and all the points in the aligned second set of point are used as a reference, and the second set of points is aligned with respect to the first set of points.
