		DEVICE AND METHOD FOR MANAGING THE ELECTRIC BRAKING OF A VEHICLE
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		The invention relates to a device for managing electric braking power (1), which device comprises a continuous bus (10), said continuous bus including: a connection pole (12) connecting to an electric traction machine (21) of a vehicle, said machine being associated with an inverter (20) which, in braking mode, delivers an electric braking power over the continuous bus; a connection pole (13) connecting to an electric power storage battery (30); a dissipation branch (1D) connected at a connection point (11) to the continuous bus, said branch including an electronic dissipation switch (1D1) connected in series with a dissipation resistor (1D2); a current collector (15) on the continuous bus, disposed between the connection point (11) of the continuous bus and the connection pole (13) connecting to a battery; and a controller (18). The device also includes an electronic charge switch (1C1) between the connection point at which the dissipation branch (1D) is connected to the continuous bus (10) and the connection pole connecting to a battery of the continuous bus, said switch controlling the flow of current over the continuous bus from the connection pole connecting to an electric machine to the connection pole connecting to a battery. The controller evaluates the difference between the recharge current limit of the battery and the current on the continuous bus, such as to leave the electronic charge switch closed while the current on the continuous bus is below the recharge current limit of the battery.
