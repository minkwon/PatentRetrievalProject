		Biogas, fertilizer and recyclable water producing system
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A resource production system using a byproduct from the production of ethanol for efficiently producing biogas and fertilizer from the byproducts of ethanol production. The resource production system using a byproduct of a production of ethanol generally includes a plurality of processes for producing an inorganic renewable fertilizer, such as struvite and a non-fossil fuel source of energy, such as biogas, by using various types of byproducts produced by the ethanol plant, such as but not limited to whole stillage, thin stillage and thin stillage solubles. The process also produces an organic fertilizer, such as biosolids and a liquid stream suitable for further processing to produce recyclable water at the ethanol plant.
