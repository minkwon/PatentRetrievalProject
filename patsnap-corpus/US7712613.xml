		Water filter materials and water filters containing a mixture of microporous and mesoporous carbon particles
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A filter and filter material for providing or treating potable water is provided. The filter includes a housing having an inlet and an outlet, a filter material disposed within the housing, the filter material formed at least in part from a mixture of a plurality of mesoporous and microporous activated carbon particles. Preferably, at least some of the mesoporous activated carbon filter particles are coated with a cationic polymer, and even more preferably, at least some of the particles are coated with a cationic polymer and silver or a silver containing material. Kits comprising filters and information relating to the reduction, killing or removal of bacteria, viruses, microbials, and TTHM are also provided.
