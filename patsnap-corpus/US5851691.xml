	<str name="Abstract">
		An electrical apparatus, such as a pager, comprises a case having a battery holder in the form of a battery receiving recess of a size to receive the larger (or largest) of at least two coin-shaped batteries having respectively different predetermined diameters. A resiliently biased edge contact for bearing on the periphery of a battery protrudes through an aperture in a wall of the recess and another electrical contact is provided in the base of the recess. In order to adapt the battery holder to accommodate a smaller size of coin battery, resiliently biased battery locating abutment means are provided in the base of the recess at location(s) coinciding with the periphery of the smaller (or smallest) battery size when placed in the recess. The abutment means when extending into the recess maintain the smaller (or smallest) battery in contact with the resiliently biased edge contact but are depressed when the largest battery is placed in the recess. The recess is partially covered by a lip which enables the smaller battery to be maintained in engagement with the abutment means in spite of being deflected upwards by the another battery contact
