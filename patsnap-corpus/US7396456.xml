		Cruising aeration apparatus and method
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A cruising aeration apparatus and a method are described. The cruising aeration apparatus comprises an aeration device for circulating the water in an aquatic pool, at least one conducting element connected to the aeration device for conducting the aeration device along a traveling route, and a controller. The at least one conducting element can be a rope or a float loop used as a separation line of a swimming pool. The pool water is drawn and pressurized by the aeration device and then ejected from nozzles of the aeration device. The nozzles on the front side and the rear side of the traveling route of the aeration device produce different counterforce. The aeration device is driven along the traveling route by the difference between the counterforce of the front side and the rear side of the traveling route. At least one switch is installed to control the opening and the closing of the nozzles, and is located on the side of the aeration device providing larger counterforce. The on/off of the at least one switch is controlled by the controller, so that the counterforce magnitude of the front side and the rear side of the aeration device can be interchanged to drive the aeration device to move reciprocally.
