		Biological treatment and filtration system equipment
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		The present invention provides a biological treatment and filtration system equipment that can reliably remove most of materials harmful to the human body and arsenic components not capable of being removed until now, which are contained in the raw water, by a series of purification operations. A biological treatment and filtration system equipment includes a filter sand layer 111 that treats raw water by microorganism to filter impurities; a raw-water supplying unit 112 that is provided on the upper side of the filter sand layer; an outlet 113 that is provided on the lower side of the filter sand layer and is used to take out filtered water; a filtering net 114 that is detachably held on the upper side of the filter sand layer in a vessel, and includes a net body 114A to which absorbent capable of absorbing arsenic components contained in raw water is adhered, and a frame 114B fixed to an outer periphery of the net body; and a tube (114E) that is provided at an outer portion of the frame and is inflated by pressure fluid so as to seal a gap between the frame and an inner surface of the vessel.
