		Washing machine equipped with an air bubble generator having contraction/enlargement exhaust nozzles
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Outlets of a contraction/enlargement exhaust nozzle type are formed in an air bubble-generating plate from which fine air bubbles are generated. The outlets are constituted with outer outlets and inner outlets. The outer outlets are formed along edge portions of the air bubble-generating plate and the inner outlets are formed in the inner portions of the air bubble-generating plate. Each of the outlets has a flow-in portion, a contraction portion, and a flow-out portion which are aligned in a coaxial line and have different diameters, so that each of the outlets are formed in a shape of a contraction/enlargement exhaust nozzle type. A diameter of the flow-out portion is smaller than a diameter of the flow-in portion, but larger than a diameter of the contraction portion. A height of the contraction portion is larger than a height of the flow-out portion, but smaller than a height of the flow-in portion. The diameters of contraction portions of the outer outlets are smaller than those of contraction portions of the inner outlets. Fine air bubbles are generated from an air bubble generator having outlets of a contraction/enlargement exhaust nozzle type.
