		Systems and methods using multiple solvents for removal of lipids from fluids
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		This invention is directed to systems and methods for removing lipids from a fluid or from lipid-containing organisms from a fluid, such as plasma. These systems combine a fluid with at least one extraction solvent, which causes the lipids to separate from the fluid or from the lipid-containing organisms. The separated lipids are removed from the fluid. The at least one extraction solvent is removed from the fluid or at least reduced to a concentration enabling the fluid to be administered to a patient without undesirable consequences. Once the fluid has been processed, the fluid may be administered to a patient who donated the fluid or to a different patient for therapy.
