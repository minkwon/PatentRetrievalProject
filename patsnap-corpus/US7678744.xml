		Hydrocarbon industry servicing fluid and methods of performing service operations
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A hydrocarbon industry servicing fluid comprises an irradiated fluid that is biologically inert. The fluid may be irradiated with ultraviolet light. A method comprises performing a hydrocarbon industry service operation with an irradiated fluid that is biologically inert. The method may comprise disposing of the irradiated fluid to the environment or capturing the irradiated fluid when the service operation is complete. The method may further comprise re-irradiating the captured irradiated fluid to produce a remediated fluid, and performing a service operation with the remediated fluid.
