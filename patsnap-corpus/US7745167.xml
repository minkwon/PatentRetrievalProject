		Fiber-optic probes and methods of measuring biological materials
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method for monitoring fluid media, such as a dynamic biological system, in a biological reactor containing developing culture fluid media. The method includes the step of directing light into the fluid media by way of one or more optical fibers to produce an illuminated fluid media and then measuring the intensity of light reflected from the illuminated fluid media by way of one or more optical fibers, the optical fibers being partitioned from the fluid media by a transparent window having inner and outer surfaces; the fibers having ends terminating adjacent to and confronting the inner surface of the window and extending in a direction away from the window, the corresponding ends of the fibers being radially and circumferentially spaced from one another, the corresponding ends of the fibers having converging and intersecting longitudinal projections therefrom, the intersecting longitudinal projections from the fibers being entirely within the window. Additionally, a fiber-optic probe is discussed.
