		Portable computer usable with a specific battery pack or ordinary battery
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A portable computer, capable of being powered by a specific rechargeable battery pack or by ordinary batteries, comprises a battery door opening formed in one side of a housing for mounting various electronic devices together with a printed circuit board, and a battery storage casing having a bottom and four side walls and an upper battery insertion opening to store the specific battery pack or ordinary batteries. The battery storage casing is mounted in the housing so as to make the upper battery insertion opening face the battery door opening. The internal space of the battery storage casing is designed to accommodate either the specific rechargeable battery pack or ordinary batteries. Thus, the portable computer may be driven by the specific rechargeable battery pack or one or more ordinary batteries installed in the battery storage casing. The battery storage casing has at least a support ridge formed between the bottom wall and side walls, and the battery pack has at least a corresponding recess to receive the support ridge, so that the battery pack is properly inserted in the battery storage casing. Additionally provided are a charging-protective circuit, first contacts connected to the charging-protective circuit in the battery storage casing, and second contacts formed in one side of the battery storage casing to make electrical connections with the first contacts.
