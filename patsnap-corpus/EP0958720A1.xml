		METHOD AND DEVICE FOR COOLING OF ELECTRONIC/COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND USE THEREOF
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		The invention relates to a cooling system for cooling of electronic/computer equipment in a station, where the equipment is arranged in an equipment room. The system includes a cooling battery (18) and a fan device (19), where the fan device (19) causes a heat exchanging air circulation between battery (18) and equipment where the air, via air guiding device (38), is guided from the battery (18) to the equipment. According to the invention there is in the air guiding device (38) a first chamber (31) with an inlet (37) which communicates with the battery (18), and a second chamber (32) with an outlet (39) which communicates with the equipment. The first and second chambers are separated by a low impulse device (30), preferably in form of a perforated partition wall equipped with filter cloth. By that is effected that the turbulant flow of the air which leaves the fan (19) changes to laminar flow when it flows towards the equipment, so that no warm surrounding air is mixed into the air flow. The invention also relates to a special air guiding device intended to be used at such a system, and a procedure for cooling, which procedure is based on what is applied in the system.
