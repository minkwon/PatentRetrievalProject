		Stormwater treatment system with flow distribution overflow/bypass tray
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A stormwater treatment system, including a treatment container for treating stormwater through a bioretention mechanism. The treatment chamber includes an overflow/bypass system, including a flow distribution tray or flume that includes a distribution compartment or channel, an overflow dam or weir, and an overflow/bypass compartment. The stormwater distribution compartment or channel includes one or more openings for stormwater to be treated to fall onto the filter media located within the treatment container. When high flow rates are obtained that exceed the capacity of the unit, the overflow/bypass stormwater enters the overflow/bypass compartment where it is received by an overflow/bypass outlet pipe to be directed out of the container without such water being treated or further treated by the filter media.
