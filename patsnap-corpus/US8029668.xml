	<str name="Abstract">
		An apparatus and method for treating raw water. The apparatus comprises a vessel having an inlet for the raw water and an outlet for the skimmed water, and wherein the vessel contains the raw water, and a rotor mechanism for creating a plurality of gas bubbles within the raw water. The apparatus further comprises a disperser device, operatively associated with the rotor mechanism, for dispersing the plurality of gas bubbles from the rotor mechanism within the vessel, and wherein the gas bubbles create an oily froth on the top of the raw water, and a skim tray, positioned about the rotor mechanism, is provided for removing the oily froth from the top of the raw water as well as a secondary skimmer positioned within the skim tray. In one preferred embodiment, an external skim tank that is configured to deliver a gas to the rotor mechanism and wherein the external skim tank is configured to receive the oily froth from the secondary skimmer.
