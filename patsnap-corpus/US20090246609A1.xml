		BATTERY COVER LATCH MECHANISM AND PORTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICE USING SAME
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A battery cover latch mechanism (100) used in portable electronic device (200) is described including a cover member (10) and a latch member (20). The cover member defines a fitting cavity (128). The cover member is fitted and slidable within the cavity. The cover member includes a deformable loop structure and a latch portion (26). The loop structure includes a resilient biasing portion (24). The loop structure is deformed and the biasing portion is biased so that the latch member is fitted within the cavity when in a latched position. The loop structure can be further deformed and the biasing portion further biased so that the latch member slides within the fitting cavity and the latch portion is transferred from the latched position to a released position.
