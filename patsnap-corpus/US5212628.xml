		A versatile, compact portable work station comprising a computer, a printer, and other peripherals, including but not limited to a digital camera, an optical scanner, a cellular telephone, a modem, and the like, that are efficiently interconnected with one another and stored within a carrying case. A computer tray supports the computer in spaced alignment above the printer. The computer tray is adapted to be advanced relative to the printer to permit easy access to both the printer and computer. The computer, printer and other peripherals are powered from a lead-acid battery that is stored within the carrying case. Also included in the case is a main control panel having a plurality of switches that are selectively operated to respectively connect the battery to one or more of the computer and peripherals, such that the work station is controlled completely from the carrying case.
