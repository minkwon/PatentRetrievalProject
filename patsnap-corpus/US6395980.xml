	<str name="Abstract">
		In a battery case mounted on electronic equipment, the thickness of the battery case is reduced as obtaining the holding force of batteries with respect to vibration and impact by use of a case main body with a simple structure and a case cover. A depth of a battery containing portion of the case main body 1 is structured such that a side face of each battery is protruded outwardly than an end face of a frame portion in a state that the batteries 2 are contained. On the other hand, the case cover 10 is formed of plate material covering the side face of each of the respective contained batteries 2, and plate-like magnets 14 and 15 are adhered onto faces opposite to the respective batteries 2. The case cover 10 is attached to the respective dry batteries by an absorbing force of the plate-like magnets 14 and 15 to share a holding force between the dry batteries, thereby preventing the dry batteries from being detached even if vibration and impact act. Since there is no need to provide an attaching mechanism for the case cover 10 to the case main body 1, a reduction in the battery case can be improved.
