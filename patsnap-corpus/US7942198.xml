	<str name="Title">
		Aerator for a well water pumping system
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A novel aerator for use inside a well casing in conjunction with a submersible pump, the aerator comprising a check-valve with a nozzle for spraying a portion of a water supply that is being pumped by the pump. The spray is directed towards the well water within the well casing and is calibrated to provide enough agitation to promote the evolution of dissolved gases in the water both as it is sprayed and also as the spray contacts the surface of the well water. The check-valve is calibrated to operate at a pressure threshold to ensure that spraying occurs only when the pump is running.
