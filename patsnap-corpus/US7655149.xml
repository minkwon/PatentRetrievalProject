		Oil absorbent kenaf balls and kits, and methods of making and using the same
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		This invention is based upon the discovery that kenaf balls that are comprised of an entangled mass of kenaf fibers are highly useful for absorbing oil and other organic liquids from oil spill areas on land or water. In fact, the kenaf balls of this invention are capable of absorbing oil in an amount of over 1000% of their own weight and in some cases even over 1800% of their own weight. The subject invention more specifically discloses a kenaf ball which is comprised of an entangled mass of kenaf fibers, wherein the kenaf ball has a density which is within the range of about 0.02 g/cc to about 0.15 g/cc, and wherein the kenaf ball has a mass which is within the range of 0.2 grams to about 10 grams.
