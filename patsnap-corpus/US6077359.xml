		Procedure and device for the chemical and electrolytic treatment of printed circuit boards and conductor films
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method of treatment of printed circuit boards or conductor films with a chemical, electrolytic, or rinsing treatment liquid, and to a device for carrying out the method, where the printed circuit boards or conductor films are transported in a horizontal direction by transport means, In order to accelerate these processes, the surfaces of the printed circuit boards or conductor films must be exposed to a macroflow in order to apply active treatment liquid. Furthermore, the micromaterial exchange into the diffusion layer must be reinforced. This exchange is brought about by the use of hydrodynamically acting cavitation generators, which form cavitation bubbles in the liquid jets. The treatment liquid is set into an eddy current movement in the generators because the treatment liquid is applied at high pressure in a circuit through the nozzles generating the cavitation bubbles, and is conveyed to the surface in a large quantity. The use of the method is particularly effective in processing fine conductor printed circuit boards with fine bores and blind holes.
