		CONCEPT-STRUCTURED IMAGE SEARCH
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		The concept-structured image search technique described herein pertains to a technique for enabling a user to indicate their semantic intention and then retrieve and rank images from a database or other image set according to this intention. The concept-structured image search technique described herein includes a new interface for image search. With this interface, a user can freely type several key textual words in arbitrary positions on a blank image, and also describe a region for each keyword that indicates its influence scope, which is called concept structure herein. The concept-structured image search technique will return and rank images that are in accordance with the concept structure indicated by the user. One embodiment of the technique can be used to create a synthesized image without actually using the synthesized image to perform a search of an image set.
