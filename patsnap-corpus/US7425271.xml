	<str name="Title">
		Method for treating sludge
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Sludge can be treated by placing it in a carrier sized for bulk shipment of sludge by road or by rail. An antipathogenic substance such as lime is mixed into the sludge located in the carrier in order to treat pathogens in the sludge. At least one mixer adapted for mixing sludge throughout the carrier is employed. A dispenser such as a conduit or a loader bucket can dispense the antipathogenic substance so that the mixer can mix the substance with the sludge. The sludge is transported in the carrier either before or after the mixing with the antipathogenic substance. The mixture of sludge and antipathogenic substance is allowed to remain in the carrier long enough to treat pathogens with the substance before unloading the sludge from the carrier at a destination established for utilization, storage, transfer or disposal of the sludge.
