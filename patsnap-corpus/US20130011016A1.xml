		DETECTION OF OBJECTS IN DIGITAL IMAGES
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method to detect objects in a digital image. At least one image representing at least one frame of a video sequence is received. A given color channel of the image is extracted. At least one blob that stands out from a background of the given color channel is identified. One or more features are extracted from the blob. The one or more features are provided to a plurality of pre-learned object models each including a set of pre-defined features associated with a pre-defined blob type. The one or more features are compared to the set of pre-defined features. The blob is determined to be of a type that substantially matches a pre-defined blob type associated with one of the pre-learned object models. At least a location of an object is visually indicated within the image that corresponds to the blob.
