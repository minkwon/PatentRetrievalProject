	<str name="Title">
		Method for the treatment of acid mine drainage
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A process for neutralizing acid mine drainage which includes a neutralizer and binder component consisting of steel slag in an amount of 75% to 95% by weight of the agglomeration, a sodium carbonate selected from the group consisting of soda ash and pulp liquor in an amount of 0.5% to 25% of the agglomeration, and, optionally, a lime component selected from the group consisting of limestone sand and slag. Further included is a dissolution control and filtration component consisting of an organic material in an amount of 0.24% to 15% by weight of the agglomeration selected from the group consisting of recycled newsprint, sphagnum peat moss, and sawdust. Next is a dispersant and neutralizer component consisting of a surfactant in an amount of 0.01% to 0.075% by weight of the agglomeration. The agglomeration may further comprise an oxidation component such as calcium peroxide, potassium permanganate, and hydrogen peroxide.
