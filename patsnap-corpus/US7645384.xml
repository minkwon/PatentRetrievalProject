		Environmental remediation method using ozonophilic bacteria within a liquid coating of bubbles
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Remediation for groundwater, soil, sediment bodies, bodies of water, tanks, pipes, and their surrounding areas are described. Remediation includes treating a site contaminated with toxic organic compounds by assessing for the presence or absence of suitable ozonophilic bacteria at the site and introducing ozone to the site. The ozonophilic bacteria are introduced to the site if the ozonophilic bacteria are not present or not present in sufficient quantities in the site. Ozone is introduced to the site in an amount sufficient to stimulate growth of the suitable ozonophilic bacteria. Other oxidants can also be used.
