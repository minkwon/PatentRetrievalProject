		Method of biofiltration of a liquid effluent
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method of biofiltration of a liquid effluent by simultaneous nitrification and denitrification uses the adding of an oxygen source at a predetermined rate and optionally the adding of a carbon source (such as whey) thus enabling the complete transformation of the nitrates (NO.sub.3) present in the effluent at the time of treatment through a biofilter. The specific operating conditions favoring the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification include the controlled injection of a slight quantity of air, adjustment of the level of nitrogen load (TKN+NO.sub.3) and the level of carbon load thereby making possible elimination for the most part of the release of unwanted nitrogen in the form of NO.sub.3 or NO.sub.2.
