		Method for wastewater treatment with resource recovery and reduced residual solids generation
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A wastewater treatment system is provided including an aerobic membrane bioreactor and an anaerobic digester system connected to receive wasted solids continuously from the aerobic membrane bioreactor and also connected to return effluent from the anaerobic digester system continuously to the aerobic membrane bioreactor. Further, a process is provided for treating wastewater including the step of wasting a volume fraction of organic cell mass from an aerobic membrane bioreactor to an anaerobic digester system and maintaining a solids retention time (SRT) in the bioreactor that is (1) greater than a time needed to achieve growth of organisms suitable for converting carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD) into cell mass and (2) less than a time at which substantial decay of the organisms occurs. The system and process may further include optional pretreatment and/or phosphorus and/or nitrogen removal downstream of the membrane bioreactor system.
