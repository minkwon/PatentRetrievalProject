		Removal of contaminants from water using sugar based surfactant enhanced ultrafiltration
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Embodiments of the present invention relate to the removal of contaminants from water using sugar based surfactant enhanced ultrafiltration. Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a process for removal of an at least slightly water-soluble organic compound from an organic-contaminated water solution to provide a purified water solution, including: adding a surfactant to the organic-contaminated water solution in sufficient quantity to achieve at least a critical micellar concentration of the surfactant in the organic-contaminated water solution, wherein the surfactant comprises an alkylglycoside, to provide a micellar water solution comprising micelles comprising the surfactant and the organic compound; contacting an ultrafiltration membrane with the micellar water solution under pressure and temperature conditions sufficient for liquid flow through the ultrafiltration membrane to take place; and collecting liquid permeating the ultrafiltration membrane to provide the purified water solution.
