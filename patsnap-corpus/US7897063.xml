		Composition for denaturing and breaking down friction-reducing polymer and for destroying other gas and oil well contaminants
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A composition and method for breaking down and denaturing friction-reducing compound introduced into the ground during the drilling of gas and oil wells and for destroying other contaminants and biohazards naturally present within and artificially introduced into hydrocarbon wells, which are formed as a result of the drilling and pumping processes. The composition includes several species of oxidizing agent compounds that are effective in breaking down hydrogen sulfide produced by bacteria as well as the friction-reducing polymer used during drilling and several other organic compounds.
