		Method of sequestering carbon dioxide in aqueous environments
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		The present invention provides a method of sequestering carbon dioxide in aqueous environments. In a first step, an area is assessed to determine whether the area is capable of supporting the addition of organisms of higher trophic level (OHTL). Next, OHTL are added to the area in order to produce enough rapidly sinking and refractory particulate matter (PM) to sequester carbon dioxide above the level of carbon dioxide sequestration that exists before the addition of OHTL. Preferably, the PM produced by the OHTL sinks at rates significantly greater than and/or is significantly less biodegradable than that produced by other components of the biological carbon pump. Finally, this increase in the level of carbon dioxide sequestration is quantified. The method of the present invention may also include the step of reporting the quantified increase in the level of carbon dioxide sequestration.
