		Fixing structure for battery
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A fixing structure for a battery positions the battery in a casing of an electronic device. The fixing structure includes at least a connecting portion, at least a locking portion, and a receiving portion. The connecting portion is on one side of the battery and with a waterproof element. The locking portion is on the other side of the battery and is opposite to the connecting portion. The receiving portion is on the casing and with a first inserting portion and a plurality of second inserting portions. The first inserting portion and the second inserting portions correspond in position to the connecting portion and the locking portion respectively. Hence, the fixing structure protects the electronic device against permeation of water and ensures secure positioning of the battery.
