	<str name="Abstract">
		An improved washing machine equipped with a bubble producing apparatus and a bubble producing control method thereof capable of advantageously reducing the needed amount of detergents and preventing laundry from being damaged and entangled. The washing machine includes a washing machine body; an outer tub disposed inside the washing machine body for receiving detergent-containing water therein; an inner tub disposed inside the outer tub for receiving detergent-containing water and laundry therein and having a plurality of water drain holes formed on the circumferential surface thereof; and a bubble producing apparatus disposed on the bottom of the outer tub for producing bubbles. In addition, there is provided a bubble producing control method for a washing machine equipped with a bubble producing apparatus, which includes a first step which drives a drive motor clockwise and counterclockwise; a second step which computes and compares the number of pulses outputted in accordance with the amount of laundry to be washed so as to compute the amount of laundry in the inner tub; a third step which enters a wash cycle for a predetermined time in accordance with the amount of laundry; a fourth step which performs a normal washing mode in accordance with the number of the pulses; and a fifth, step which sets a detergent-containing circulation and a circulation time in accordance with the amount of laundry.
