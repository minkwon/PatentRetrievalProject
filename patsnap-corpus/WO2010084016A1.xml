	<str name="Abstract">
		The invention relates to a battery (200), comprising a cell package (201) made of at least a single cell in a cell housing, an electronic component (100, 202), electrical conductors (205a, 205b) between the cell package (201) and the electronic component (100, 202), and an injection molded piece (203) that substantially completely surrounds the electrical conductors and that positively connects both to the cell package (201) and to the electronic component (100, 202) and connects the same to each other, wherein the external contact surfaces (101, 204) of the battery (200) are also integrated in the electronic component (100, 202), in addition to at least one electronic circuit (103). The invention furthermore relates to a method for producing such a battery, wherein a cell package (201) made of at least one electrochemical single cell in a cell housing and an electronic component (100, 202), in which the external contact surfaces (101, 204) of the battery are also integrated in addition to at least one electronic circuit (103), are arranged in an injection mold and the remaining free space is filled with a liquid plastic compound that is then cured.
