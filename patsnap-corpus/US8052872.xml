		Methods and device for enhancement of anaerobic digestion
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Methods of enhancing anaerobic digestion of wastewater are provided. The methods comprise pressure oxidation of digester material to remove sulfide and/or regenerate iron. Also provided are a pressure oxidizer device and a wastewater treatment system having one or more of such devices. The methods, device, and system have application in treatment of municipal wastewater, wastewater of agricultural and livestock operations, and in biofuels production.
