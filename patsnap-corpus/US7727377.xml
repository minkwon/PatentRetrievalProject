		System and process for the treatment of multiphase residues
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A system 100 is described for the treatment of multiphase residues having unlimited content of water, oil and solids to obtain hydrocarbons and other products, said system comprising multiphase residue feed system 10, inert gas system 20 and reduced pressure system 30, tubular reactor 40 provided with three heating zones Z-1, Z-2 and Z-3 with a temperature gradient and transportation helicoid 42 to displace the residue mass throughout the reaction zones, the hydrocarbon products and water being collected in a system 60 of condensers 61, 62 and 63 linked to a system 70 of bubbling vessels 71, 72 and 73, reactor 40 being operated in the sealed mode and being provided with a multiphase residue inlet 43 and exit 44 of solid product. The solid product is collected in a system 50 comprising upper valve 51 and lower valve 52, and intermediate silo 53 and then directed to post-treatment system 90 for activation aiming at industrial utilization. The process using the system 100 of the invention is also described. Multiphase organic residues, petroleum residues, pure or in admixture in any amount, from chemical and pharmaceutical industries, paper and pulp industry, and mining industries can be processed in the inventive system. Besides, it is possible to recover phenols from foundry sands in the system and process described.
