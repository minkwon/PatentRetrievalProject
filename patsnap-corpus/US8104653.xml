		Air-breathing battery backpack frame
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		An air breathing battery apparatus is connected to the hollow tubing of a backpack frame to provide an uninterrupted, water-resistant, light-weight power supply during extended remote operations in the field. Air breathing power sources are connected to the hollow tubes of the backpack assembly to provide a constant uninterrupted air supply in a relatively small package that fits easily into the backpack frame with only negligible added weight. The positioning of the air breathing power source in a backpack composed of hollow tubing also protects the battery from inclement weather or when the user is in water, for example, while fording a river or stream, to permit the uninterrupted use of the electronics powered by the battery.
