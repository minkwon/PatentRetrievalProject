		APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR RETRIEVING IMAGE
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		An image retrieval method includes reading from a first database a first image group mapped to an object as a retrieval target, and extracting an image feature quantity of a plurality of images of the first image group. A second image group mapped to an object as a search key is read from a second database and an image feature quantity of a plurality of images of the second image group is extracted. Similarity is determined between the first image group and the second image group, based on the image feature quantity of the plurality of images of the first image group and the image feature quantity of the plurality of images of the second image group. On an output device, as retrieval results, the plurality of images of the first image group are displayed in order of similarity of the object as the retrieval target based on determined similarity.
