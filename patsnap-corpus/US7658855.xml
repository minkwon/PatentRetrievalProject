		Apparatus and process for water conditioning
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A conditioning process and equipment are provided for removing hardness from water circulated in a system, such as an evaporative cooling system. A sidestream from such system is routed to a reaction chamber and back to the system. A conditioner is added to the sidestream water and in some embodiments is routed through a sidestream inlet from the top of the reaction chamber to its lower portion. A buffer is added to the sidestream exiting the reaction chamber, and in some embodiments is added upstream of a pH sensor. A fluid bed develops in the reaction chamber consisting of conditioner, buffer, precipitated solids and sidestream water. An upper outlet on the reaction chamber regulates the height of the fluid bed, and a drain provides for periodic discharge of the lower fluid bed. In another embodiment, a corrosion inhibitor blend is pre-mixed with the buffer.
