		Self-contained biofuel production and water processing apparatus
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A system for making biofuels comprising methane, ethanol, and biodiesel comprises a tank (100) with a sealable lid (120). An algae mass (105), water, and either a yeast or bacterial culture (106) is added to the tank. Under high temperature conditions, sour (CO.sub.2-containing) methane is produced and stored in a container (130). Under lower temperature conditions, ethanol and CO.sub.2 are produced. Heated or cooled water passed through a water jacket (160) that surrounds the tank maintains the proper temperature within the tank. The CO.sub.2 is stored in a second container (270). The sour methane and the CO.sub.2 are optionally passed through a scrubber. Scrubbed methane is suitable for use as a fuel and drives a generator (275) that supplies power to various parts of the system. Carbon credits will be available for CO.sub.2 that is trapped in the scrubber. A still (185) separates ethanol and water for later use. Biodiesel can also be made in the apparatus by first making ethanol, then employing a transesterification process.
