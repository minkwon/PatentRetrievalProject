		Portable computer battery charging apparatus
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A portable computer battery charger has a hollow housing which is supportable on a generally horizontal surface and has a power wiring board horizontally disposed within a bottom portion thereof beneath a depending pair of vertically tilted, open-topped wells formed in the top wall of the housing. The power wiring board is adapted to receive electrical charging energy from a source thereof, and has a plurality of resilient metal clip members electrically connected thereto and projecting upwardly through bottom end openings in the wells. To charge a pair of elongated portable computer batteries charging ends thereof are placed in the wells which support the batteries in a vertically tilted orientation in which major longitudinal portions of the batteries project upwardly beyond the top side of the housing. Electrical contact areas on the bottom ends of the batteries contact and deflect the clip members, and receive electrical charging energy therethrough, and the weights of the tilted batteries cause their lower end portions to be brought into forcible frictional contact with interior side surface portions of the wells to thereby positionally stabilize the charging batteries relative to the housing.
