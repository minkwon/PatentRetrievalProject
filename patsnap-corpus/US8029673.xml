	<str name="Abstract">
		The present invention relates to a vertical-horizontal filter unit for the biological purification of polluted water, comprising an upper zone of a soil patch planted with plants, having inlets for the polluted water, and arranged underneath a sand layer with a lower filter zone made of gravel and at least one removal point for the purified water, wherein between the upper and lower filter zones a barrier layer with openings is arranged and the filter unit is sealed against the soil on the sides and at the bottom. The openings in the barrier layer are arranged along the edge and/or the barrier layer does not reach the edge of the patch completely. The invention is characterized in that the upper zone acts as an aerobically cleaning zone and the lower zone as an anaerobically cleaning zone.
