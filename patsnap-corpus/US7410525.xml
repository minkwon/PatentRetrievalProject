		Mixed matrix membranes incorporating microporous polymers as fillers
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		The present invention is for a polymer/polymer mixed matrix membrane and the use of such membranes in gas separation applications. More specifically, the invention involves the preparation of polymer/polymer mixed matrix membranes incorporating soluble polymers of intrinsic microporosity as microporous fillers. These polymeric fillers of intrinsic microporosity exhibit behavior analogous to that of conventional microporous materials including large and accessible surface areas, interconnected micropores of less than 2 nm in size, as well as high chemical and thermal stability, but, in addition, possess properties of conventional polymers including good solubility and easy processability. Gas separation experiments on these mixed matrix membranes show dramatically enhanced gas separation performance for CO.sub.2 removal from natural gas. Mixed matrix membranes prepared in accordance with the present invention can also be used in the separation of the following pairs of gases: hydrogen/methane, carbon dioxide/nitrogen, methane/nitrogen and olefin/paraffin such as propylene/propane.
