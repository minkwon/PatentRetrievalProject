	<str name="Abstract">
		A method and apparatus for aerating liquid which includes an aeration chamber having an inlet port at its lower end an outlet port at its upper end wherein the chamber is divided into multiple internal chambers using a plurality of internal divider walls. The chamber is weighted with a base member so that it will not float. Air is inlet at its upper end through an air inlet hole into an upper air manifold wherein the air then travels downwardly through an air feed pipe to a plurality of air outlet holes wherein the air is released and rises thereby causing a flow of material through the inlet ports upwardly along the internal divider walls and aeration chamber and then out of the chamber at its upper outlet port so that the stream of material is directed onto a series of stationary concentric ridges wherein the solids in the liquid material are forcefully impacted against the stationary concentric ridges so as to break the solid particles up into smaller particles.
