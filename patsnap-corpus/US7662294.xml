	<str name="Title">
		Method for reducing organic contamination
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Certain exemplary embodiments provide methods for reducing a concentration of a contaminant associated with a medium, which can be any substance or material, such as soil, water, air, and/or fluid. In one exemplary method, the medium is treated with a ferric chelate and an oxidizing agent in amounts effective to oxidize at least a portion of the contaminant.
