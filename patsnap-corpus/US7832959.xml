		Method of restoration of a highly saline lake
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method of restoring a lake that has a high saline level is disclosed herein. In order to restore the lake, a series of concentric dikes or levees are provided that separate the lake into a plurality of smaller lake sections, each having a water surface. The smaller lake sections include an outer lake section which is next to the periphery of the lake and one or more inner lake sections. Each dike and each smaller lake section water surface have an elevation. Water is flowed from an influent source to the outer lake section and then to each of the inner lake sections. The outer lake section surface has a higher elevation. The inner lake section surfaces have cascading lower surface elevations. At a central area, a breathing brine area is provided that is surrounded by the smaller lake sections to provide an area that can be used to concentrate brine. The smaller lake sections can have differing salinity levels for sustaining diverse marine and plant life.
