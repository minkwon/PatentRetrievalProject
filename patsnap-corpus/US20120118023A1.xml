		PUMP-TYPE LAUNDRY WASHING MACHINE
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		This invention is a vertical machine for washing and wringing clothes by mean of a closed pumping circuit which supplies the washing or centrifuging system. The washing system uses a special eductor which produces a cavitation effect above the clothes, combined with a rotary washing system which produces the paused circulation of the clothes; the rotation of the washing system is produced by the same water flow. The centrifuging is made in the inner tub impelling its rotation by means of a turbine, thus the tub rotates over the virtual axis which passes through the center of gravity thereof and the clothes for being wringed, furthermore is used a special annular chamber for auto-balancing. The rotation of the tub over the virtual axis is achieved making float the inner tub by means of the special supports which combine the speed components of any point of the tub. The basic ideas of the above concepts are applied in different practical versions, as well as with modifications to a horizontal axial axis or front-loading washing machine or an industrial washing machine.
