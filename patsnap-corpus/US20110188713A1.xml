		FACIAL IMAGE RECOGNITION AND RETRIEVAL
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method or system providing face verification, including obtaining a set of features from a selected image and determining if there are any faces in the selected image. If faces are determined a dominance factor is assigned to at least one face and verification of an identity of the at least one face in the selected image is attempted and a confidence score returned. In attempting to verify the identity of the at least one face any identity information is extracted from metadata associated with the selected image. Also disclosed is a method of facial image retrieval, including defining a query image set from one or more selected facial images, determining a dissimilarity measurement between at least one query feature and at least one target feature. This enables identification of one or more identified facial images from the target facial image set based on the dissimilarity measurement.
