		Method and system for treating organically contaminated waste water
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method and system for treating organically contaminated waste water for reuse, by: introducing the waste water into a sedimentation tank to remove a significant portion of the organic contaminants; circulating the waste water from the sedimentation tank to an anoxic mixing chamber for denitrifying the waste water; circulating the waste water from the anoxic mixing chamber to a rotary biological contactor to nitrify the waste water by aeration, and to assimilate organic materials therein by bringing the waste water into contact with a biological medium, to thereby output nitrified waste water; and recirculating a portion of the nitrified waste water outputted from the rotary biological contactor back to the anoxic mixing chamber to enhance the nitrifying and denitrifying of the waste water.
