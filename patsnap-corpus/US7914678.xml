		Backwashing unsaturated wastewater filter
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A compact high efficiency combined biological and physical unsaturated wastewater treatment filter configured for periodic backwashing is disclosed. The filter utilizes packed media and removes pollutants and pathogens from wastewater and other dirty water sources. The filter comprises a periodic backwashing means to less the chance that biofilm growth will clog the media pores. However, such backwashing still leaves sufficient biofilm attached to the media to maintain a very high level of treatment. In the preferred embodiment, the filter utilizes high frequency dosing to cause pore saturation at or near the surface during dosing and shortly thereafter in order to maximize distribution uniformity and to induce downward airflow into the media. The system provides a number of unexpected benefits; including allowing a very low distribution pressure and providing high oxygen transfer at low energy utilization into the filter media for aerobic biodegradation of pollutants.
