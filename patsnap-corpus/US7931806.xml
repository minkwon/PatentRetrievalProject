	<str name="Abstract">
		The present invention is directed to processes and business methods and wastewater treatment units for converting the waterborne residuals from wastewater generated by food processing plants into an ingredient suitable for use in animal feeds. The ingredient produced by the processes of the present invention has a high protein content and can be used as a replacement for conventional sources of animal feed protein such as fish meal.
