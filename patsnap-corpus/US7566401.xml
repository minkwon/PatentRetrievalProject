	<str name="Title">
		Process for separating and isolating xanthines, individual polar protic monomers, and polar protic oligomers
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		An improved process for separating and isolating individual polar protic monomer(s) and/or oligomer(s) on the basis of degree of polymerization. A liquid sample containing polar protic monomer(s) and/or oligomer(s) is introduced into a liquid chromatography (LC) column packed with a polar bonded stationary chromatographic phase. The individual polar protic monomer(s) and/or oligomer(s) are separated via a binary mobile phase elution. One or more individual fractions containing the monomer(s) and/or oligomer(s) are eluted. The polar protic monomer(s) and/or oligomer(s) may be proanthocyanidins, hydrolyzable tannins, oligosaccharides, oligonucleotides, peptides, acrylamides, polysorbates, polyketides, poloxamers, polyethylene glycols, polyoxyethylene alcohols or polyvinyl alcohols. The binary mobile phase comprises an A phase consisting essentially of a polar aprotic solvent and a B phase consisting essentially of a polar protic solvent. A process for separating and isolating xanthine(s) (e.g., caffeine and theobromine) from polar protic monomer(s) and/or oligomer(s). A liquid sample containing xanthine(s) and polar protic monomer(s) and/or oligomer(s) is introduced into an LC column packed with a polar bonded stationary chromatographic phase. The xanthines are separated via an isocratic mobile phase elution, and one or more individual fractions containing the xanthines are eluted.
