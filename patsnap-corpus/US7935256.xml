		Method for the treatment of waste water from florfenicol production
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method for the treatment of waste water from florfenicol production is provided, which mainly comprises the steps as follows: adding iron chips or steel slag to waste water from a copper salt workshop, regulating the pH value, filtering, then adding limestone, lime or Ca(OH)2 and having a solid-liquid separation; blending the treated waste water and waste water from a splitting workshop, oxidizing the residual reductive matter by ozone and removing NH3-N by blowing; blending the treated water and waste water from esterifying or florfenicol workshops and diluting the blended water, adding phosphate and microelement, regulating the pH value, then having an anaerobic treatment in an anaerobic reactor; diluting the treated waste water, then having an aerobic treatment in an aerobic reactor. The method also can comprise the steps as follows: blending the waste water from all workshops, adding phosphate and microelement, regulating the pH value, blending the treated waste water with recycling anaerobic water and having a settling treatment, then having an anaerobic treatment in an anaerobic granular sludge bed reactor, diluting the treated waste water and having an aerobic treatment in a SBR.
