	<str name="Abstract">
		The present invention describes improved methods and systems for treating waste water and solid waste, which may include the addition of catholyte and anolyte. The methods and systems of the present invention may be used to treat waste water and solid waste from animal farms, such as for example, hog farms, dairy farms, and cattle and sheep ranches. The methods and systems of the present invention may also be used to treat waste water from other sources, such as human waste or farm runoff from irrigation.
