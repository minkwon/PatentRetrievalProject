		Systems and methods for automatically reducing data search space and improving data extraction accuracy using known constraints in a layout of extracted data elements
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method of automatically narrowing data search space and improving accuracy of data extraction using known constraints in a layout of extracted data elements for classified documented is provided. The method includes: analyzing each document to classify it within a document category, each category having a corresponding set of expected layouts; analyzing each electronic document to automatically extract images and text features; automatically constructing a data structure including a layout of the extracted features and layout relationships amongst the extracted features, wherein each of the extracted features in the layout maintains a reference to neighboring features and wherein closely related features are merged to form a combined feature; automatically narrowing data search space by detecting and removing parts of the layout that are not associated with any data elements using the data structure; and automatically detecting data using the extracted feature layout and the layout relationships amongst the extracted features.
