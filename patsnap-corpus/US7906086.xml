		Carbon dioxide sequestration materials and processes
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		The disclosure provides methods and systems for sequestering and/or reducing carbon dioxide present in an industrial effluent fluid stream containing carbon dioxide. A scrubbing material comprising a first component, a second component (distinct from the first component), and preferably water, is contacted with the effluent fluid stream. The first component comprises a source of calcium oxide and a source of alkali metal ions. The second component comprises a slag having one or more reactive silicate compounds. Methods of reducing carbon dioxide from exhaust generated by combustion sources, lime and/or cement kilns, iron and/or steel furnaces, and the like are provided. Carbon dioxide emission abatement systems are also disclosed. Methods of recycling industrial byproducts are further provided.
