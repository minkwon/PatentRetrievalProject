		FINE BUBBLE GENERATING APPARATUS
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A fine bubble generating apparatus that efficiently generates fine bubbles on the nanometer level. A cylindrical member has a cylindrical inner peripheral surface, a first end wall member closing one end of the cylindrical member, and a second end wall member closing the other end of the cylindrical member. The cylindrical member and the first and second end wall members define a fluid swirling chamber. The cylindrical member has a fluid inlet hole at a position close to the second end wall member to supply a gas-liquid mixed fluid in the tangential direction of the peripheral surface of the fluid swirling chamber. The second end wall member has a fluid outlet hole extending therethrough along the center axis of the inner peripheral surface of the fluid swirling chamber. The gas-liquid mixed fluid is introduced into the fluid swirling chamber at a position close to the second end wall member.
