		NOZZLE FOR GENERATING MICROBUBBLES
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		In conventional nozzles, small holes provided for an orifice correspond to a throttle part, and, when the nozzle is used for cleaning, in particular, when hot water containing a cleaning agent is circulated, if the removal of foreign particles gotten into the hot water is insufficient, the foreign particle might clog the small hole to block it up. The blockage of only one to two small holes largely influences the condition of generating microbubbles to result in insufficient generation of microbubbles. A nozzle main body is provided with a water introduction port for introducing pressurized hot water from the bottom center of the nozzle main body into the main body, a core cylinder provided with an opening for a circumferential face is inserted into the nozzle main body to form a throttle part between an edge part of the bottom outer circumference of the core cylinder and an edge part of the bottom inner circumference of the nozzle main body, and hot water passed through the throttle part is introduced into the inner part of the core cylinder through the opening of the circumferential face of the core cylinder and hot water in which microbubbles are generated is ejected to the outside.
