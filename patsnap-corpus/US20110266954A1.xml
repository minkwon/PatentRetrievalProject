		MULTIFUNCTIONAL RECHARGEABLE LED LIGHT
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		This invention relates to a type of multi-functional rechargeable energy saving LED light. Each of the existing lightings has only one function and use, and they are not convenient in respect of operation and portability, and thus cause a lot of inconvenience. This invention comprises a lamp base, a retractable tube, a lamp case, a lamp filter, LED bead(s) and a mounting board, a circuit board and a lithium battery. The retractable tube connects the lamp base to the lamp case. The LED bead(s) and mounting board are near the top of the lamp case where the lamp filter is located at the top on the surface of the lamp case. Power switch and indicator light are installed on the lateral side of the lamp case. The lithium battery is housed in the retractable tube while a circuit board is placed inside the lamp case. AC-DC constant voltage power module, a charge management module for the lithium battery, DC-DC constant current power module and a smart module are located on the circuit board (6).
