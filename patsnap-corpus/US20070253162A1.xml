	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A cooling system has one or more fans disposed within a housing adapted to attach to a consumer electronics device. The cooling system can also include a switch, a male connector and a female connector adapted to interface with the consumer electronics device and a power supply of the consumer electronics device. The cooling system may have a pass-through design, in which it receives power from the power supply of the consumer electronics device, taps into the power for its own operation, and passes the power onto the consumer electronics device, and/or it receives power from the consumer electronics device, taps into the power, and passes the power on to another device. The cooling system can also include one or more battery chargers attached to the housing for charging batteries related to the consumer electronics device.
