	<str name="Abstract">
		A physiological monitoring apparatus comprising a cellular phone handset connected to a cellular phone network is disclosed. The handset includes a removable battery container (12) having a physiological monitoring device (14) contained therein as well as a battery power source (13). The battery power source (13) provides power for the operation of the handset (11) as well as providing power for the physiological monitoring device (14). The battery container (12) has detectors (15) located on its outer surface, communicating with the physiological monitoring device (14) through apertures in the battery container (12). Acoustic coupling means (18) are adapted to couple tones produced by the physiological monitoring device (14) with a sound microphone of the cellular phone handset. The physiological monitoring device (14) is activated by placing it against the chest of a patient and the cellular phone handset is used to connect to a remote monitoring station via the cellular phone network. The cellular phone handset sends an electromagnetic signal corresponding to the acoustically coupled tonal signal produced by the physiological monitoring device (14).
