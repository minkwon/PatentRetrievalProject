	<str name="Title">
		Mechanical/biological filter for a filtration system
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A mechanical and biological filter system where in use water entering into a housing first contacts the mechanical filter covering access to the biological filter. As the water travels through the mechanical filter before reaching the biological filter, the water has been processed and cleaned by the mechanical filter, preventing the mechanically filtered elements from being disposed on the biological filters, to improve the reliability of the biological filter. The filtering of the water first through the mechanical filter provides for maximum use of the surface area of the biological filter for their intended purposes of fostering beneficial bacteria growth. The two stages of filtered water ultimately exits out of the housing through a housing outlet.
