		BATTERY BOX AND ELECTRONIC DEVICE USING THE SAME
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A battery box includes at least one battery and a switch apparatus. The switch apparatus includes a first conductor, a second conductor, and an operation element. The first conductor includes a first conductive portion and a first contact portion protruding from the first conductive portion. The second conductor includes a second conductive portion and a second contact portion protruding from the second conductive portion. The operation element is movable with respect to the housing and able to resist the second conductive portion along with the movement of the operation element. When the operation element is moved to resist the second conductive portion, the second contact portion contacts with the first contact portion, and when the operation element is moved to separate from the second conductive portion, the second contact portion does not contact with the first contact portion. An electronic device using the battery box is also provided.
