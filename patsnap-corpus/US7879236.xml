	<str name="Abstract">
		A lagoon of effluent is established, comprising a set of sub-portions at different levels in the lagoon associated with a corresponding set of concentrations of dissolved oxygen, each sub-portion of the lagoon having a different concentration of dissolved oxygen. An incubator comprising a set of sub-portions associated with said set of concentrations of dissolved oxygen is established, each sub-portion of the incubator having a different concentration of dissolved oxygen. A volume of effluent from each sub-portion of the lagoon is transmitted to a corresponding sub-portion of an incubator having a substantially similar concentration of dissolved oxygen as said sub-portion of the lagoon. A first remediated volume of effluent is generated in said corresponding sub-portion of the incubator responsive to proliferating a first microorganism which uses a first compound in said volume of effluent as substrate for growth, the first microorganism enabling a first chemical reaction which alters the first compound.
