		Information classification paradigm
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A mechanism to classify source documents into one of two categories, either likely to contain desired information or unlikely to contain desired information. Generally some form of rules based classification in conjunction with deeper analysis using advanced techniques on difficult cases is utilized. The rules based classification is generally good for eliminating cases from further consideration and for identifying documents of interest based on generally discernable relationships between data or based on the presence or absence of data. The deeper analysis is used to uncover more complex relationships between data that may identify documents of interest. Portions of the process may use the entire document while other portions of the process may use only a portion of the document.
