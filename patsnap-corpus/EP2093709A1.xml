		DOCUMENT IMAGE FEATURE VALUE GENERATING DEVICE, DOCUMENT IMAGE FEATURE VALUE GENERATING METHOD, AND DOCUMENT IMAGE FEATURE VALUE GENERATING PROGRAM
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		When connected regions contact in one image and are separated in the other image with respect to a centroid of connected regions obtained from a registered and a binary image of a registered image, different feature points are extracted due to contact and separation, and so feature value which are matched to each other could not be acquired.
A document image feature value generating device is a document image feature value generating device which extracts feature points from an input image which is input and generates a feature value from the feature points and includes integrating feature point extracting means and feature value generating means. The integrating feature point extracting means determines connected regions from the input image which is input, computes centroids of the connected regions and the feature points, integrates at least some of the connected regions, and obtains an integrating feature point from a centroid of an integrated connected region. The feature value generating means sets a principal feature point from among the feature points obtained and generates a feature value of the integrated connected region from neighbor feature points which are arranged near to the principal feature point and the integrating feature point.
