		Process for treating pond water
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A process for the treatment of phosphoric acid plant pond water facilitating the recovery of phosphorus values from the input pond water. In certain aspects the process recycles solids from a later stage neutralization and separation into the clarified liquid stream from an initial clarification and neutralization stage. A sufficient amount of solids are added to the clarified liquid stream to effect the pH-dependent precipitation of a phosphate product. In alternative aspects an intermediate pH-dependent precipitation of a phosphate product is achieved through the addition of a neutralizing agent. The phosphate product is further characterized by a low concentration of fluoride. In addition the phosphate product can be further processed to a high purity technical grade phosphoric acid. In certain aspects the process employs flocculating agents to enhance the formation of precipitates. In further aspects, methodologies taught herein facilitate the reduction of silica in the process streams. Processes according to the present invention are further characterized by an enhanced recovery of treated water, reduced sludge impoundment and reduced lime consumption when compared to conventional double liming processes.
