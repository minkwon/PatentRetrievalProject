		Automated cell sample enrichment preparation method
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method for automated cell enrichment preparation where biological cells are injected into a first subchamber and flowed through the first subchamber, through a large pore filter and into a second subchamber so that the large pore filter retains particles large particles in the first subchamber, while the biological cells pass through the first filter into the second subchamber and are retained by a small pore filter. After clearing, the biological cells are stained. A solvent exchange leaves the biological cells in solvent and they are released into a concentration module where a portion of the solvent is removed to form an enriched concentrated cell suspension.
