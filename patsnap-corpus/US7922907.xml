		Process for water treatment
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method for removing contaminant from feedwater by forming a dispersion comprising bubbles of a treatment gas in a continuous phase comprising feedwater, wherein the bubbles have a mean diameter of less than about 5 .mu.m and wherein the treatment gas is selected from the group consisting of air, oxygen, and chlorine. A method for removing contaminants from a feedwater by subjecting a fluid mixture comprising feedwater and a treatment gas to a shear rate greater than 20,000 s.sup.-1 in a high shear device to produce a dispersion of treatment gas in a continuous phase of the feedwater. A system for treating feedwater to remove contaminants therefrom is also presented, the system comprising at least one high shear mixing device comprising at least one generator comprising a rotor and a stator separated by a shear gap; and a pump configured for delivering feedwater and treatment gas to the high shear mixing device.
