		METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING A FLAT FAN PAINT SPRAY PATTERN
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method and apparatus for spraying a coating material such as paint, in a flat fan pattern. In the gun a stream of paint under a relatively low pressure is caused to flow in an annular film. Streams of gas at a slightly higher pressure are directed against the paint film so that the gas is sheared into microbubbles which are entrained in the paint stream to form a froth. The froth flows through a chamber in which the bubbles disperse uniformly in the paint and is then discharged through a narrow slit nozzle effective to give it a fan shape. As the froth is released to atmospheric pressure, the microbubbles of air expand rapidly and rupture, causing the paint to disintegrate into finely atomized drops. The apparatus includes a cooperating orifice plate and collar which define a thin annular paint flow channel; and a plurality of air injection channels which intersect the paint flow channel. Air is introduced through these channels and is directed against the paint film. In the preferred gun, the nozzle includes a hemispherical endwise portion provided with an elongated discharge slot. A protuberance or ball is disposed within the nozzle and deflects the froth so that the froth passes through a relatively narrow passageway between the ball and nozzle. A modified gun includes a conventional airless flat fan orifice; and does not utilize an internal ball.
