	<str name="Abstract">
		Provided is a shower apparatus which can stably produce and supply bubbly water to nozzle holes, causing finely divided water droplets of relatively large, uniform size to land continuously on a user so as to allow the user to enjoy a shower with a voluminous feel as if the user were being showered by large drops of rain. The shower apparatus includes a water supply unit, a throttle unit adapted to eject passing water downstream, an aeration unit adapted to produce bubbly water by aerating the water ejected through the throttle unit, and a nozzle unit provided with a plurality of nozzle holes used to discharge the bubbly water, wherein an ejection speed changing means is installed in the water supply unit to at least partially vary ejection speeds of the water ejected from respective throttle channels of the plurality of throttle channels of the throttle unit.
