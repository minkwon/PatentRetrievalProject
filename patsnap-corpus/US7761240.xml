		Systems and methods for automated diagnosis and grading of tissue images
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Systems and methods are provided for automated diagnosis and grading of tissue images based on morphometric data extracted from the images by a computer. The morphometric data may include image-level morphometric data such as fractal dimension data, fractal code data, wavelet data, and/or color channel histogram data. The morphometric data may also include object-level morphometric data such as color, structural, and/or textural properties of segmented image objects (e.g., stroma, nuclei, red blood cells, etc.).
