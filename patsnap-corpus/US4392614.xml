		Portable paint sprayer
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A portable paint spraying device for generating a paint spray by centrifugally impelling liquid paint from the edge of a vertically oriented spinning disc. The disc is driven by an electric motor which also drives a conveyor screw used to lift the paint upwardly from a reservoir or container through a vertically oriented pump tube and into a spray chamber in the sprayer housing. The pump tube has a horizontal portion at the upper end thereof terminating in a delivery orifice through which the liquid paint is discharged into a centrally located recess or well in the front face of the disc. The disc has a relatively large flat annular region surrounding the central well which is in turn surrounded by an outer peripheral angled flange or lip having a feathered edge. The spray dispersion pattern is defined by a vertically oriented spray discharge slot in the pump housing, a movable shutter between the spray discharge slot and disc, and a series of baffles within the spray chamber which also assist in returning excess liquid to the paint reservoir. The amount of paint exiting from the paint sprayer may be controlled by controlling the amount of overlap between the movable shutter and spray discharge slot; also by diverting a portion of the paint which is lifted by the conveyor screw back to the reservoir instead of delivering same onto the sprayer disc.
