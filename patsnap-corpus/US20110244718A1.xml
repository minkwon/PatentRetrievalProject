	<str name="Title">
		Flexible holder for connectors
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A holder is capable of providing flexible support for the connector of a flexible printed circuit board, and has particular applicability for battery recharging cradles for a mobile computing device or hand-held scanner. The holder comprises a receptacle having a rear wall and two side walls, along with protrusions to slidably retain the connector therein. The rear wall connects, using a radiused bend, to a connecting wall, which may form an acute angle relative to the rear wall, and which may neck down to improve rotational capability. The connecting wall transitions, using a radiused bend, to a transverse wall, and from its ends are two cantilever straps extending towards the receptacle, and thereby foaming an acute angle relative to the connecting wall. An upward protruding boss on the end of each strap aids translational and rotational flexibility, where the holder is mounted to a surface using orifices in the bosses.
