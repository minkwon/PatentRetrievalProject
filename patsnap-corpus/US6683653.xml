		Electronic camera and dial control device of electronic equipment
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		When the interior of the electronic camera is seen from the back side, a battery is arranged at the part corresponding to the inside of a grip part arranged at the right side of the casing so that the long axis of the battery is along the right side of the casing, and an imaging part including a taking lens and a CCD is arranged at the upper left. Below the imaging part, an LCD monitor and a memory card holder are arranged parallel to a plane perpendicular to the optical axis of the taking lens. In this arrangement, the components of the camera are arranged in a compact size. On the back face of the camera body, a mode dial is arranged at a position that can be operated by the thumb of a hand holding the grip part. The mode dial is capable of rotating within a plane perpendicular to the optical axis of the taking lens. A dial control device including the mode dial has a double structure that comprises a push-type cross key, which is able to incline in upward, downward, right and left directions, and a ring-shaped rotatable mode dial at the circumference of the cross key. This dial control device achieves a multiple function dial/button, which is slim, easy to operate and compact.
