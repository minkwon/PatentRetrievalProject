	<str name="Abstract">
		When a small block area enters a first two-dimensional code during a scan and features of the image within the area of a position in the first two-dimensional code coincide with a two-dimensional code, the block area is specified as containing a code and a recognition process is performed in the nearby areas. When the recognition of the two-dimensional code has been successful, the area of the first two-dimensional code is further extracted. When the extraction of the area of the first two-dimensional code has been successful, the scan using the small block area is further continued to search for a second two-dimensional code. With an already recognized entrance to the area of the first two-dimensional code, the area is skipped to continue the search. The second two-dimensional code is detected at a high speed by repeating the operation.
