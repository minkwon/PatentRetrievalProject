	<str name="Abstract">
		A method for treating a portion of liquid waste manure comprising adding a first reagent to the portion in a first vessel to cause the formation of waste manure flocs of a first size; adding a second reagent to liquid portion to cause growth of the waste manure flocs of the first size into separable waste manure flocs; adding optionally a third reagent to the portion of liquid containing waste manure flocs to cause further growth of the separable waste manure flocs; separating the liquid volume containing separable waste manure flocs into a waste manure sludge and a first filtrate; and dewatering the waste manure sludge in a filtration system comprising a first filter including a first housing, a first displaceable filter medium, and a first displacement actuator disposed between the first housing and the first displaceable filter medium.
