	<str name="Title">
		Debris trap and method of trapping debris
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Most commercial &amp; residential buildings have rainwater collection systems that consist of leaders and gutters that collect water coming off the roof. These leaders and gutters are connected to drain pipes that channel the water away from the structure, usually into a dry well or storm drain. A substantial add-on to the leader and gutter system is a debris trap with an overflow port. The debris trap/overflow port may be attached to the leader at waist height (for easy access) to collect leaves, tree droppings, windblown litter and other materials. This debris can be easily discarded by opening an access panel to empty a built-in strainer. When a dry well or storm drain becomes saturated, water will back up through the leader causing seepage and overflow into the building and create erosion that can damage the foundation. The function of the overflow port is to divert water from the drain pipe away from the foundation. The debris trap/overflow port system not only channels water away from the building but also prevents overflow of organic materials that can accumulate along the foundation.
