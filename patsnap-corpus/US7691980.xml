	<str name="Title">
		Enhanced capacity and purification of antibodies by mixed mode chromatography in the presence of aqueous-soluble nonionic organic polymers
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		This invention relates to the use of mixed mode chromatography for purification of at least one intact non-aggregated antibody from a mixture containing intact non-aggregated antibodies and undesirable materials, including fragmented or aggregated antibodies, host cell proteins, DNA, endotoxin, and/or virus. This invention further relates to the integration of such a method into a multi-step procedure with other fractionation methods for purification of antibodies suitable for in vivo applications.
