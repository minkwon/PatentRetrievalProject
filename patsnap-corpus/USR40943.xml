		Method in treating aqueous waste feedstream for improving the flux rates, cleaning and the useful life of filter media
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A method in treating aqueous feedstream in diverse plant site environments is disclosed for improving filter flux rates, cleaning filter media and prolonging useful operative life of media. In preferred embodiments the method is provided with steps for contacting, reacting, pressurizing and equalizing ozone and feedstream within a central area or multiple areas and sustaining high pressure throughout the system to achieve qualitatively and quantitatively improved permeate products, and reject for recycle. The method and system provide an improved cleaning and processing system characterized by an ozone-concentrated, homogeneous single phase liquid conversion of a generated ozone gas mixture and a feedstream source containing organic and inorganic pollutants. The method improves and monitors ozone oxidizing power and reflecting ORP values, and provides further media cleaning and improved oxidation reactions for attack on pollutants on each cycle/recycle operation.
