		Handwritten word spotter using synthesized typed queries
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A wordspotting system and method are disclosed for processing candidate word images extracted from handwritten documents. In response to a user inputting a selected query string, such as a word to be searched in one or more of the handwritten documents, the system automatically generates at least one computer-generated image based on the query string in a selected font or fonts. A model is trained on the computer-generated image(s) and is thereafter used in the scoring the candidate handwritten word images. The candidate or candidates with the highest scores and/or documents containing them can be presented to the user, tagged, or otherwise processed differently from other candidate word images/documents.
