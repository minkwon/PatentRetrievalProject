	<str name="Title">
		Process for reducing waste volume
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		The present disclosure is generally directed to a process for decreasing waste material. The process includes loading organic material into a vessel, supplying ozone and water into the vessel, separating the organic material into solid material and liquid material, and reconditioning water from the liquid material for use again. The ozone oxidizes and breaks down at least a portion of the organic material.
