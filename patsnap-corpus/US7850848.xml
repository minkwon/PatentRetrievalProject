		Apparatus and process for biological wastewater treatment
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A self-sustaining wastewater treatment facility abates greenhouse gas abatement, captures CO.sub.2 and produces biomass to address multiple critical environmental needs. The facility includes an array of rotating media wheels that create an optimum ordered mixing of algae for sustained growth. Biomass harvested from the rotating media wheels may be provided to other processing facilities to produce, for instance, bio-fuels. Waste CO.sub.2 from the processing facility may also be returned to the treatment system for enhanced algae growth. Bacteria are provided to form a symbiotic relationship with the algae, fueled by sunlight to effectively remove toxic materials from the wastewater. The multi-functional facility may also be integrated into a regenerative facility in which the biomass obtained from the algal and bacterial colonies is used in a separate facility and byproducts of the operation of the separate facility are used by the multi-functional facility to fuel further algal growth.
