		Medical work station heat dissipating chassis
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A medical workstation chassis including a first compartment and a second compartment. The first compartment is formed as a monolithic aluminum casting which includes pedestals which mate to heat generating electronic components such as integrated circuits mounted within the first compartment. A plastic thermal barrier is sandwiched between the first compartment and the second compartment to attenuate heat transfer from the chassis to the components, such as a disk drive and battery, housed within the second compartment. A series of heat sink fins are formed along the lateral perimeter of the aluminum casting and are interconnected to the pedestals by a series of large cross section ribs which are also formed as part of the aluminum casting.
