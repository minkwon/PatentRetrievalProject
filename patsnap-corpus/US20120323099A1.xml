		IMPLANTABLE MEDICAL DEVICE ELECTRODE ASSEMBLY
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		An implantable medical device (IMD) includes an electrode that forms a first snap-fit attachment area and an insulator that forms a through-hole, a second snap-fit attachment area and a third snap-fit attachment area. The second snap-fit attachment area mates with the first snap-fit attachment area of the electrode. The IMD further includes a body including an elongated conductive housing and a feedthrough wire extending therefrom. The body forms a fourth snap-fit attachment area on one end that mates with the third snap-fit attachment area of the insulator such that the feedthrough wire extends through the through-hole of the insulator. The housing encloses at least one of a battery, a sensor, and an electronic circuit. The insulator functions to electrically isolate the electrode from the housing of the body.
