		Controlling shopper checkout throughput
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		The present invention provides a solution for controlling checkout throughput. Specifically, under the present invention a set of attributes of an item will be obtained. An analysis of the set of attributes will then be performed to determine whether an inconsistency exists based on a tolerance threshold. Such analysis can include, for example, comparing the weight of the item to its expected weight. This can help determine if a mistake has been made or fraud has been committed. Whether an inconsistency is observed is based on a tolerance threshold. For example, a certain deviation (i.e., the tolerance threshold) from an expected value could be allowed to could be allowed to reduce errors during the checkout process and thereby increase checkout throughput. As such, the present invention allows the tolerance threshold to be tuned based on a desired checkout throughput.
