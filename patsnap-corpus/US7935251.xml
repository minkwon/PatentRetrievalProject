		Waste treatment apparatus
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		A facility for treating solid and liquid waste includes a receiving station, a screening station, a preprocessing station, an alkali mixing station, a press station and a processing station. The screening station is connected to an inlet capable of receiving liquid and solid waste and includes a screen for capturing at least some of the solid waste. The preprocessing station is in fluid communication with the screening station, and includes a degrit chamber for settling out an additional amount of the solids. The alkali mixing station includes an alkali for mixing with the waste to stabilize the waste at a predetermined pH level. The press station receives the stabilized waste and includes a press for separating out an additional portion of the solids. The processing station includes at least one aerobic microorganism generating unit for converting nitrites into nitrogen gas and consuming carbon-based waste material.
