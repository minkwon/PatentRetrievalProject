	<str name="Abstract">
		The present disclosure provides methods and systems for purifying an impaired liquid. In a particular example, the disclosure provides methods and systems for purifying water containing a solute. A feed stream of solute containing water is introduced in a flow chamber. A permeate stream of water at least substantially free of the solute is placed in the flow chamber. A hydrophobic membrane is placed between the feed stream and the permeate stream. A vacuum is applied to the permeate stream. A vapor pressure differential causes water to vaporize from the feed stream, pass through the hydrophobic membrane, and condense in the permeate stream.
