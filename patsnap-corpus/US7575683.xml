	<str name="Abstract">
		The present invention includes a portable Sub-Surface Flow Constructed Wetlands system for removing pollutants from a body of water. The portable wetlands system includes a sealed container having pipes for the inflow and outlet of the water. The system also includes a high surface area substrate located in a lower portion of the container and a heavier substrate and at least one emergent aquatic plant located in an upper portion of the container. The container of the system may be mounted on a trailer and the entire system may be light enough to be capable of being towed by a normal mid-sized pickup truck. The present invention also contemplates a method for removing pollutants from water using such a portable wetlands system. The water to be treated is flowed through the portable wetlands system in order to remove pollutants. The present invention further contemplates a method for constructing such a portable wetlands system.
