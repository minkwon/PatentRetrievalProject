		Content Detection and Payment System
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Systems and techniques for detecting presentations of sponsored content and identifying persons bearing the content. A set of sponsored content items is identified for which a bearer presenting the content item in qualifying ways may receive payment, and a group of participating users is established, with information being stored for the users so as to allow for identification of a user presenting a content item in order to direct proper credit to the user making the presentation. A plurality of video feeds are identified and monitored and any video feed in which a sponsored logo appears is further examined to identify a bearer of the content item. Upon identification of the bearer, presentation of the content item is evaluated and appropriate payment is calculated. Details of content item presentations and payments may be stored in connection with users and evaluated to provide insight into the circumstances surrounding and influencing presentations.
