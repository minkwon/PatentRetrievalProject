	<str name="Title">
		Manufacturing method of oxidative water to be employed for sterilization
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		This invention provides the oxidative mixed water with pH around 7.4 ranging from the weak acidity to weak alkalinity, high power of killing microorganisms, and high power of healing wound by electrolysis using the three-compartment cell composed of an anode compartment, a cathode compartment, and a middle compartment between the anode compartment and the cathode compartment. Mixing anode water with cathode water produced using the three-compartment device forms the oxidative mixed water.
