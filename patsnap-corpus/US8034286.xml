		Ultrasonic treatment system for separating compounds from aqueous effluent
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		Novel ultrasonic treatment systems for separating compounds in an aqueous effluent and processes for using the ultrasonic treatment systems are disclosed. More particularly, the ultrasonic treatment systems use ultrasonic energy to energize adsorbent to provide efficient and effective removal of compounds from aqueous effluents, such as textile effluents.
