A power transformer is located within the chassis to produce a DC signal from an AC input. A retractable power cord of the brick is connected at one end to the transformer and connectable at a second end to an AC outlet. A DC power pin connected to the DC signal of the power transformer is positioned to engage a DC power jack of the mobile computer when the apparatus is attached to the mobile computer panel. The apparatus may further include a retractable locking cable and retractable network connections. The apparatus may include pass through connectors to provide external access to connectors of the mobile computer rear panel and a battery to provide power to the mobile computer.
