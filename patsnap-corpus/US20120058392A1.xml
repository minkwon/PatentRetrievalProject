		Rechargeable battery with aluminium anode, graphite cathode and an electrolyte containing aluminium vapour in plasma state
	</str>
	<str name="Abstract">
		We propose a rechargeable battery with aluminium anode. In order to avoid the high reactivity of aluminium ions with most liquid electrolytes, we present an electrolyte containing aluminium vapour in plasma state. The battery is contained in a quartz cylinder heated with microwaves to a sufficiently high temperature to ionise the aluminium ions in the vapour. The anode is graphite. By receiving electrons from the external circuit, carbon atoms in the graphite hexagonal structure receive 1 or 2 or 3 negative charges and combine with aluminium ions from the electrolyte. Four charges in the carbon atom corresponds to Al.sub.4C.sub.3, aluminium carbide, which can also be found. It has a melting point of 2100.degree. C., it is a solid at the plasma temperature and sticks to the anode.
