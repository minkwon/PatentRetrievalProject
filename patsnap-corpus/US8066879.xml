	<str name="Abstract">
		An apparatus and method for passively generating a current flow in a body of water is disclosed. The passive water circulating apparatus has an aeration plate having a central opening; a plurality of flotation members joined to the aeration plate, the plurality of flotation members being adapted and disposed for maintaining buoyancy of the aeration plate above a water surface; an uplift tube member having a central orifice in fluid communication with the central opening of the aeration plate; a concentrator member disposed at an end of the uplift tube opposite the aeration plate, the concentrator member having a bottom opening in fluid communication with an upper opening, the bottom opening being wider than the upper opening and the upper opening being connected to the uplift tube member; and a plurality of bio-substrates suspended from the concentrator member below the bottom opening, the plurality of bio-substrates providing a substrate for growth of microbes.
